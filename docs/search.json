In POL232, you will learn an elementary use of statistical software called R. In particular, you will use RStudio, a popular and accessible graphical user interface (GUI) to R.\nR is an open source software, and many packages developed by contributors around the world are available for free. To make your learning of R accessible, this book will cover only a limited set of packages and their functionalities specifically used in POL232. Even if you have no experience of programming before, don’t worry, as you will learn what you need in order to complete this class step by step, and we will focus only on a manageable set of functionalities of R. By the end of the semester, you are expected to be able to conduct an elementary quantitative data analysis and write a research paper based on it.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Open RStudio Desktop\nYou may open R and use it directly through its own GUI, but many people find using R through RStudio more intuitive and easier than using R directly. When you use RStudio, you don’t need to open R. Just open RStudio only, as it also quietly starts R behind its GUI. Let’s open RStudio. Then, you will see the following GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we have our work done by executing a command. We enter a command after the &gt; prompt in the R Console, and then, the command will be executed by R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, we can also choose a menu from its GUI, and RStudio translates our input into a command and execute it in the R Console. Let’s see an example by reading the datasets we will use in this class.\n\n\n2.1.2 Datasets Used in POL232\nI prepared the datasets you will use in this class in the RData format, which is available on the class Quercus site. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file to your computer (remember where you downloaded it).\n\n    POL232.RData\n\nLet’s open POL232.RData in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Load Datasets to RStudio: load()\nWe use a menu from GUI of RStudio to load POL232.RData to RStudio. First, choose an open folder icon on the Environment tab on the upper right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, locate POL232.RData on your computer and choose it to open. In the following figure, I have located POL232.RData in the TEMP folder on my Desktop. Note, however, that the location where you have downloaded POL232.RData is different from mine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the content of POL232.RData appears in the upper right pane of RStudio. As you can see, POL232.RData includes five datasets named anes2020, ces2019, ipe2020, ipe2015, and usstates2010. The datasets are stored in the format called data frame in R. So I will call these datasets data frames onward. To learn more about these data frames, see the codebooks available on the class Quercus site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see on the left pane of RStudio (see the red arrow), when we chose POL232.RData to open, RStudio translated this action into an R command and executed in the R Console. The commands used in R consist of R functions. An R function mostly takes the form of function.name(...), and we input arguments in the ... within the parentheses.\nIn the above example, to open POL232.RData, RStudio executed the load() function which takes the name and location (a file path) of the file as its argument (recall that an argument refers to what we specify in the parentheses of R functions). As you can see in the above figure, RStudio used the following code to open POL232.RData.\n\n  load(\"~/Desktop/TEMP/POL232.RData\")\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Browse Data Frame: View()\nLet’s browse a data frame by entering a command in the R console directly. You may use the View() function for this purpose. Include the name of the data frame you want to browse as argument; i.e., include it inside ().\n\n  View(ces2019)\n\nThen, the data frame specified will be open at the upper left pane as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative to typing in View(ces2019) in the R console is to click ces2019 in the Environment tab at the upper right pane.  Then, RStudio will execute View(ces2019) for you to open the data frame in the upper left pane.\nYou may browse the data frame in this way. As you can see, the data frame is structured such that each row corresponds to each observation (in this case, each respondent of the survey) and each column corresponds to each variable. See ces2019_codebook.pdf for the description of the variables included in ces2019.\nI’d suggest you browse other data frames such as anes2020 and ipe2010. Try both typing in the View() function directly in the R console and clicking the name of a data frame on the Environment tab on the upper right pane.\n\n\n2.1.5 Getting Help for Functions: help() or ?\nIf you need help for a function, you may use the help() function with the name of your function of interest in the parentheses or ? operator followed by the name of the function. Try help(View) and ? View. Both of them will open the help window for View() on the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n  help(View)\n  ? View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you have a question about the usage of a specific function, you may use the help() function or the ? operator. If the explanation in the help menu is unclear to you, you may post your question on the Discussions Board of the class Quercus site.",

    "text": "2.2 R Script\nWhen you conduct an analysis in R, you should write a series of functions in an R script file and save it.\nLet’s look at a simple example. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file.\n\n    POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R is an R script. The file extension .R is used for R scripts. Open this R script file in RStudio by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “Open File…” from the menu bar or clicking the open folder icon () at the upper left corner. (Make sure you do NOT click the open folder icon () at the Environment tab on the upper right pane, because you cannot open an R script from there. Note that if you hover your cursor over the open folder icon at the upper left corner, the following message, “Open an existing file,” should appear as shown below. If you hover your cursor over the icon at the Environment tab on the upper right, the description to appear is “Load Workspace.”)\n\nThen, this R script appears in the top left window of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R contains functions to draw a scatterplot using the usstates2010 data frame. Don’t worry about these functions for now. You will learn how to draw a similar scatterplot later in the semester.\n\n2.2.1 Execute Functions from an R Script\nIf you write a series of functions in an R script like this one, you can easily repeat your analysis. From an R script file, you can execute the functions.\nIn POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, go to a line or highlight a line (or a set of lines), and then press Ctrl + Enter in Windows or Command + Return in Mac. Then, the functions chosen will be implemented in the R Console. Alternatively, you may click the “Run” icon ().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you execute all the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, RStudio will draw the following scatterplot on the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Write Comments After #\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R produced a scatterplot with a linear regression line for the relationship between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial candidate and the percent of Democratic identifiers, individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across US states.\nBelow is a copy of this R script. As I suggested above, don’t worry about what these functions in the R script are doing. I am showing the content of the R script below only to explain how you can write comments in your R script file.\n\n# Estimate a simple linear regression model for the relationship\n# between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial\n# candidate (ranney3_gub_prop) and the percent of Democratic identifiers\n# (democrat), individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across\n# US states, and assign its result to the object named \"us.\"\nus &lt;- lm(formula = ranney3_gub_prop*100 ~ democrat, data=usstates2010)\n\n# Draw a scatterplot using presidential election years.\nplot(usstates2010$democrat, usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n     type=\"n\",\n     ylim=c(0,100), xlim=c(15, 75),\n     main=\"US Gubernatorial Elections\",\n     ylab=\"Vote Share (%) of Dem Candidate\",\n     xlab=\"Democratic Identifiers (%)\",\n     cex.main=1.0, cex.lab=1.0, cex.axis=1.0)\ntext(x=usstates2010$democrat, y=usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n    usstates2010$st, col=\"blue\", cex=0.75)\n\n# Add a linear regression line.\nabline(a=us$coefficients[1],b=us$coefficients[2],\n    col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\nIn the above R script, you may notice that some descriptions are given after #. In an R script file, everything after # will not be executed by R. When R implements these functions, it ignores everything after #. Therefore, we can write comments after #.\nI suggest you sufficiently annotate your R script using # so that you can understand what you did when you come back to work on your R project after a while.\n\n\n2.2.3 Always Write an R Script\nI suggest you always create an R script file, write functions and comments in this R script, and save this script when you conduct analysis in R, because this may be the most transparent and effective way to save and reproduce your analysis.\nTherefore, in every R lab session, I will ask you to write an R script file and submit it to Quercus by the end of the lab session to earn a participation mark, so that you can develop the habit of writing R scripts.",

    "section": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script",
    "text": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script\n\nLet’s write a very simple R script to try some very basic (mathematical) operations in R.\n\n2.3.1 How to Start a New R Script\nYou may start a new file by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “New File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “R Script” from the menu bar (left in the image below) or simply clicking the “New File” icon () and choose “R Script” (right in the image below).\n\nOnce you create a new R script, you should of course save it. You can save it by choosing “File” from the pull down menu and then “Save As” (left in the image below) or clicking the save file icon (right in the image below).\n\nYou should choose an informative name for your R script. For the current purpose, name your R script “POL232_Lab1_YourLastName.R.”\n\n\n2.3.2 Very Basic Math\nFirst, write the following mathematical operations in your R script and execute them from within the R script. See Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run functions from within an R script.\n\n  1 + 5     # Addition\n  2 - 3     # Subtraction\n  4 * 7     # Multiplication\n  2735 / 45 # Division\n  2^4       # Exponents\n  sqrt(16)  # Square root\n  abs(-5)   # Absolute value\n  1:100     # Sequence of integers from 1 to 100\n\nThen, these mathematical operations will be carried out in the R Console. Each of them returns the output of the operation — for example, 6 for 1 + 5, and -1 for 2 - 3.\nRecall that R ignores everything after #, so you can annotate your R script after #.\nNext, write 5:100 as follows in your R script and execute it. You will get the output that follows — a sequence of numbers from 5 to 100.\n\n  5:100    # Sequence of integers from 5 to 100\n\n [1]   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23\n[20]  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42\n[39]  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61\n[58]  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80\n[77]  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99\n[96] 100\n\n\nIn the output, numbers in square brackets at the beginning of each line represent a position of the first entry of each line. As you see in the above output, 5 is the first entry of 5:100, and 24 is the 20th entry of 5:100, 43 is the 39th, and so forth.\n\n\n2.3.3 Create a Variable Using the Assignment Operator (&lt;-)\nWe can create a variable and assign a number or multiple numbers to this variable using the assignment operator, &lt;-. First, let’s assign a single number to a variable.\nFor example, the following operation will assign the result of 1 + 5, which is 6, to a variable named y. Write this operation in your R script and then execute it (once again, see Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run a function from within an R script).\n\n  y &lt;- 1 + 5  # The assignment operator, &lt;-, will assign the values on the right-hand-side \n              # to a variable named y.\n\nTyping in the variable name in the R Console will print its content. Try this.\n\n  y\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nIt returns 6.\nNow write the following operation in your R script and execute it to create a different variable x.\n\n  x &lt;- 7\n\nCheck its content by typing the variable name, x, in the R Console.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIt returns 7. You can overwrite a variable by assigning a different number to the variable. Write the following operation in your R script and execute it.\n\n  x &lt;- 10\n\nNow your x should be changed to 10. Type in x in the R Console to confirm.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nYou can apply mathematical operations on variables. For example, write the following operations — sqrt() to take a square root — in your R script and execute them.\n\n  y + x        # Because y = 6 & x = 10, this is 16.\n\n[1] 16\n\n  sqrt(y + x)  # This will take a square root of 16, which is 4.\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nYou may assign the result of a mathematical operation on variables to another variable. Write the following operations in your R script and execute them.\n\n  z &lt;- y + x  # z will be the result of y + x. Since y = 6 and x = 10, z = 16.\n\n  z           # Executing this from your R script is equivalent to typing in `z` into the R Console.\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 See What’s in Your Workspace (= Working Memory): ls() or objects()\nWhat you have created so far (called “objects”) in the current R session have been stored in the R’s working memory, called workspace. You can see what is available in your workspace by executing ls() or objects() without arguments (= nothing in the parentheses). objects() may be more intuitive because anything you construct in R is called an object.\nWrit the following functions in your R script and execute them.\n\n  objects()  # This function will list everything in your workspace.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\n\n  ls()       # This function does the same thing as the objects() function.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\nYou can also see what’s stored in your workspace at the Environment tab at the upper right pane.\n\nNote that everything you created and stored in your workspace will be gone, once you quit R. This is fine, as you can always recreate the objects you created in the current R session easily by running the functions recorded in your R script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Remove a Variable from Your Workspace: remove() or rm()\nIf you want to remove or erase a variable from your workspace, use remove() or its abbreviation rm(). For example, remove(x) or rm(x) will erase x from your workspace. Write the following function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(x)   # This function will remove the variable `x` from your workspace.\n\nType in x in the R Console to see that this variable is not available anymore. The error message will suggest that the variable x cannot be found.\n\n\n2.3.6 Remove Everything: remove(list=ls()) or rm(list=ls())\nIf you want to remove everything from your workspace, you may use the following function. Write this function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(list=ls())  # This will erase everything from your workspace.\n\nRun objects() or ls() to see that everything is gone. character{0} means there is nothing in your workspace.\n\n  ls()\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nMake sure you save your R script. This R script may be used as your reference in your later work.",

You can skip the following. Since this question is no longer asked in the recent versions of RStudio Desktop, you may not see this question when you quit your R session.\nHowever, I want to give the following explanations in case you encounter this question when you quit your R session, because this is a default behaviour of R, which is run quietly behind RStudio. There may be an occasion in which you will see this question.\nBy clicking “Save,” you can save all your R session in a workspace image (.RData file) and can open it the next time you start R.\nHowever, I do NOT recommend using this option. It is much better to record all your work in an R script and replicate all your work by executing the R script.\nUsing R scripts allows you to correct your mistakes easily, and all the steps of your work will be transparent. You may also allow others to replicate your work by running your R script.\nAlways choose “Don’t Save” when you quit R and write an R script instead.",

    "text": "1.2 Use RStudio from JupyterHub\nAs a UofT student, you have an access to JupyterHub. While you can download and install R and RStudio on your computer, you may also use RStudio online from JupyterHub. In this option, you can avoid all the troubles in installing R and RStudio. Especially if you encounter any issues in installing R and RStudio on your computer, this will be a viable alternative.\nIn this section, I explain how to use RStudio online through JupyterHub.\nTo access RStudio from JupyterHub, go to https://datatools.utoronto.ca/ and choose RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Log On” and login using your utorid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, RStudio Server will open on your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use RStudio online.\n\n1.2.1 Prepare for POL232 on JupyterHub\nFirst, I suggest you create a folder for POL232.\nClick “New Folder” in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in a name of the folder. Here I use “POL232.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the new folder appears in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we use the datasets in POL232.RData, we first need to upload this file to RStudio on JupyterHub. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, go to the class Quercus site and download POL232.RData.\nThen, let’s upload POL232.RData to RStudio on JupyterHub.\nClick the “Upload” icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the following pop-up window appears. You first need to choose the target directory, which is a folder to which you upload POL232.RData.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand choose the folder you just created. Here I choose the “POL232” folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, select POL232.RData on your local drive to upload.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate POL232.RData on your local drive and select it. Note that the location of POL232.RData on your local drive is different from mine shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit “OK” to upload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, POL232.RData appears in the folder you created in the lower right pane (the “POL232” folder in my case shown below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can upload other files, if necessary, to RStudio on JupyterHub in the same way.\nFor example, to complete Section 2.2, you may want to upload POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R.\nClick these files in your folder in the lower right pane to open them. Below I opened POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R that I have uploaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can use RStudio online from your browser, as you do in RStudio Desktop on lab computers.\n\n\n1.2.2 Save Output Online\nYou can save what you create in RStudio on JupyterHub online in the folder you just created. In the example shown below, I save a scatterplot produced by the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R (see Section 2.2.1).\nTo save the scatterplot, first choose “Export” on the Plots tab in the lower right pane and choose “Save as Image”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, choose the folder to which you will save the plot and specify a name of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the “Files” tab in the lower right pane, then you can see that the plot you have saved appears there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files saved in your folder is saved in your cloud account for JupyterHub. They will stay there after you log out, and you can use them when you come back to JupyterHub.\n\n\n1.2.3 Download Output\nYou can also download the files you saved online in RStudio on JupyterHub to your computer.\nCheck the file you want to download, and click “More.” Then, choose “Export” from the pull-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the pop-up window, you may change a file name, if you want. Click “Download” to save the file on your computer locally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R lab sessions during the class time or tutorial sessions, you will be required to upload the R script or some other files that you create during the sessions to the class Querus site. For this purpose, you first need to download these files to your local computer, and then, you will upload these files to Quercus from the local computer.",

    "text": "1.3 Download and Install R & RStudio\nYou may also download and install R and RStudio onto your computer. While you will open RStudio only, you need to install both R and RStudio on your computer. This is because RStudio is a GUI for R. When we open RStudio, it also quietly opens R behind.\nYou can download R onto your own computer from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) mirror site closest to your place. You may choose one of the mirror sites listed under Canada.\n\n1.3.1 R for a Windows user\n\nClick “Download R for Windows.”\nChoose “base” (or “install R for the first time”) .\nClick “Download R 4.5.2 for Windows” (“4.5.2” here refers to the version number. If the version on this site is newer — the version number is greater than 4.5.2 — then it is the latest version so download that latest version instead).\nInstall R onto your computer.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 R and XQuartz for a Mac user\n\nClick “Download R for macOS.”\nDownload an appropriate release of R for your Mac. In particular, there are different releases for Apple silicon (M1,M2,…) Macs and older Intel Macs.\nInstall R onto your computer.\nMake sure you also download and install XQuartz in order to use graphic functions of R on your Mac computer.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 RStudio\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop from the RStudio’s website. Note that there is also a commercial license of R Studio Desktop Pro, but a free Open Source Edition will suffice our purpose. Choose installers appropriate for your operating system (OS).\n\n\n1.3.4 Update\nR and RStudio are frequently updated. You don’t need to update them during the current semester, but in your future use, it is recommended that you update the versions of R and RStudio occasionally.",

    "text": "1.4 R Packages\nA package is a collection of user-written R functions, which you may download and install into your R library (i.e., onto your computer). There are thousands of packages available. You can see the currently available packages in this list.\nYou can see which packages were already downloaded in your R library in the Packages tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\nYou may also use the library() function without an argument. If you run this function in RStudio, the R packages available tab will appear in the upper left pane.\n\n  library()\n\n\nIf this is the first time you use R, what you see here is the list of default R packages which came together with the installation of R. If we want to use R packages not included in this default list, we first need to download and install them on our computer.\n\n1.4.1 Install Package: install.packages()\nIn POL232, we are going to use a few packages included in tidyverse, a popular collection of multiple R packages. If you download and install tidyverse, multiple packages included therein will be installed on your computer. In particular, we will often use dplyr and ggplot2 from the tidyverse family of packages in this course.\nTo install a package, you can use the install.packages() function.\n\n  install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nOr you may choose Install Packages… from the Tools menu.\n\nThen, type in the name of a package you want in the pop up window, and hit Install.\n\nAnother way to launch the above pop up window is to hit the Install icon () on the Packages tab at the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Load Package to Current R Session: library()\nTo use an R package you installed on your computer, you need to first load this package to your current R session using the library() function. For example, the following function loads all packages in tidyverse.\n\n  library(tidyverse)\n\nWe can now use the functions included in the family of tidyverse packages, including dplyr and ggplot2. These functions are accessible during your current R session.\nIf you quit R and restart an R session, you need to load tidyverse again by the library() function.\nNote that you don’t need to download and install the package you need every time you want to use it — once you have downloaded and installed it, it stays in your computer. You just need to load it into your current R session by the library() function, every time you start R.",
