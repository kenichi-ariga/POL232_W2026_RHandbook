In POL232, you will learn an elementary use of statistical software called R. In particular, you will use RStudio, a popular and accessible graphical user interface (GUI) to R.\nR is an open source software, and many packages developed by contributors around the world are available for free. To make your learning of R accessible, this book will cover only a limited set of packages and their functionalities specifically used in POL232. Even if you have no experience of programming before, don’t worry, as you will learn what you need in order to complete this class step by step, and we will focus only on a manageable set of functionalities of R. By the end of the semester, you are expected to be able to conduct an elementary quantitative data analysis and write a research paper based on it.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Open RStudio Desktop\nYou may open R and use it directly through its own GUI, but many people find using R through RStudio more intuitive and easier than using R directly. When you use RStudio, you don’t need to open R. Just open RStudio only, as it also quietly starts R behind its GUI. Let’s open RStudio. Then, you will see the following GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we have our work done by executing a command. We enter a command after the &gt; prompt in the R Console, and then, the command will be executed by R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, we can also choose a menu from its GUI, and RStudio translates our input into a command and execute it in the R Console. Let’s see an example by reading the datasets we will use in this class.\n\n\n2.1.2 Datasets Used in POL232\nI prepared the datasets you will use in this class in the RData format, which is available on the class Quercus site. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file to your computer (remember where you downloaded it).\n\n    POL232.RData\n\nLet’s open POL232.RData in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Load Datasets to RStudio: load()\nWe use a menu from GUI of RStudio to load POL232.RData to RStudio. First, choose an open folder icon on the Environment tab on the upper right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, locate POL232.RData on your computer and choose it to open. In the following figure, I have located POL232.RData in the TEMP folder on my Desktop. Note, however, that the location where you have downloaded POL232.RData is different from mine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the content of POL232.RData appears in the upper right pane of RStudio. As you can see, POL232.RData includes five datasets named anes2020, ces2019, ipe2020, ipe2015, and usstates2010. The datasets are stored in the format called data frame in R. So I will call these datasets data frames onward. To learn more about these data frames, see the codebooks available on the class Quercus site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see on the left pane of RStudio (see the red arrow), when we chose POL232.RData to open, RStudio translated this action into an R command and executed in the R Console. The commands used in R consist of R functions. An R function mostly takes the form of function.name(...), and we input arguments in the ... within the parentheses.\nIn the above example, to open POL232.RData, RStudio executed the load() function which takes the name and location (a file path) of the file as its argument (recall that an argument refers to what we specify in the parentheses of R functions). As you can see in the above figure, RStudio used the following code to open POL232.RData.\n\n  load(\"~/Desktop/TEMP/POL232.RData\")\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Browse Data Frame: View()\nLet’s browse a data frame by entering a command in the R console directly. You may use the View() function for this purpose. Include the name of the data frame you want to browse as argument; i.e., include it inside ().\n\n  View(ces2019)\n\nThen, the data frame specified will be open at the upper left pane as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative to typing in View(ces2019) in the R console is to click ces2019 in the Environment tab at the upper right pane.  Then, RStudio will execute View(ces2019) for you to open the data frame in the upper left pane.\nYou may browse the data frame in this way. As you can see, the data frame is structured such that each row corresponds to each observation (in this case, each respondent of the survey) and each column corresponds to each variable. See ces2019_codebook.pdf for the description of the variables included in ces2019.\nI’d suggest you browse other data frames such as anes2020 and ipe2010. Try both typing in the View() function directly in the R console and clicking the name of a data frame on the Environment tab on the upper right pane.\n\n\n2.1.5 Getting Help for Functions: help() or ?\nIf you need help for a function, you may use the help() function with the name of your function of interest in the parentheses or ? operator followed by the name of the function. Try help(View) and ? View. Both of them will open the help window for View() on the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n  help(View)\n  ? View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you have a question about the usage of a specific function, you may use the help() function or the ? operator. If the explanation in the help menu is unclear to you, you may post your question on the Discussions Board of the class Quercus site.",

    "text": "2.2 R Script\nWhen you conduct an analysis in R, you should write a series of functions in an R script file and save it.\nLet’s look at a simple example. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file.\n\n    POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R is an R script. The file extension .R is used for R scripts. Open this R script file in RStudio by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “Open File…” from the menu bar or clicking the open folder icon () at the upper left corner. (Make sure you do NOT click the open folder icon () at the Environment tab on the upper right pane, because you cannot open an R script from there. Note that if you hover your cursor over the open folder icon at the upper left corner, the following message, “Open an existing file,” should appear as shown below. If you hover your cursor over the icon at the Environment tab on the upper right, the description to appear is “Load Workspace.”)\n\nThen, this R script appears in the top left window of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R contains functions to draw a scatterplot using the usstates2010 data frame. Don’t worry about these functions for now. You will learn how to draw a similar scatterplot later in the semester.\n\n2.2.1 Execute Functions from an R Script\nIf you write a series of functions in an R script like this one, you can easily repeat your analysis. From an R script file, you can execute the functions.\nIn POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, go to a line or highlight a line (or a set of lines), and then press Ctrl + Enter in Windows or Command + Return in Mac. Then, the functions chosen will be implemented in the R Console. Alternatively, you may click the “Run” icon ().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you execute all the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, RStudio will draw the following scatterplot on the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Write Comments After #\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R produced a scatterplot with a linear regression line for the relationship between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial candidate and the percent of Democratic identifiers, individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across US states.\nBelow is a copy of this R script. As I suggested above, don’t worry about what these functions in the R script are doing. I am showing the content of the R script below only to explain how you can write comments in your R script file.\n\n# Estimate a simple linear regression model for the relationship\n# between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial\n# candidate (ranney3_gub_prop) and the percent of Democratic identifiers\n# (democrat), individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across\n# US states, and assign its result to the object named \"us.\"\nus &lt;- lm(formula = ranney3_gub_prop*100 ~ democrat, data=usstates2010)\n\n# Draw a scatterplot using presidential election years.\nplot(usstates2010$democrat, usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n     type=\"n\",\n     ylim=c(0,100), xlim=c(15, 75),\n     main=\"US Gubernatorial Elections\",\n     ylab=\"Vote Share (%) of Dem Candidate\",\n     xlab=\"Democratic Identifiers (%)\",\n     cex.main=1.0, cex.lab=1.0, cex.axis=1.0)\ntext(x=usstates2010$democrat, y=usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n    usstates2010$st, col=\"blue\", cex=0.75)\n\n# Add a linear regression line.\nabline(a=us$coefficients[1],b=us$coefficients[2],\n    col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\nIn the above R script, you may notice that some descriptions are given after #. In an R script file, everything after # will not be executed by R. When R implements these functions, it ignores everything after #. Therefore, we can write comments after #.\nI suggest you sufficiently annotate your R script using # so that you can understand what you did when you come back to work on your R project after a while.\n\n\n2.2.3 Always Write an R Script\nI suggest you always create an R script file, write functions and comments in this R script, and save this script when you conduct analysis in R, because this may be the most transparent and effective way to save and reproduce your analysis.\nTherefore, in every R lab session, I will ask you to write an R script file and submit it to Quercus by the end of the lab session to earn a participation mark, so that you can develop the habit of writing R scripts.",

    "section": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script",
    "text": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script\n\nLet’s write a very simple R script to try some very basic (mathematical) operations in R.\n\n2.3.1 How to Start a New R Script\nYou may start a new file by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “New File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “R Script” from the menu bar (left in the image below) or simply clicking the “New File” icon () and choose “R Script” (right in the image below).\n\nOnce you create a new R script, you should of course save it. You can save it by choosing “File” from the pull down menu and then “Save As” (left in the image below) or clicking the save file icon (right in the image below).\n\nYou should choose an informative name for your R script. For the current purpose, name your R script “POL232_Lab1_YourLastName.R.”\n\n\n2.3.2 Very Basic Math\nFirst, write the following mathematical operations in your R script and execute them from within the R script. See Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run functions from within an R script.\n\n  1 + 5     # Addition\n  2 - 3     # Subtraction\n  4 * 7     # Multiplication\n  2735 / 45 # Division\n  2^4       # Exponents\n  sqrt(16)  # Square root\n  abs(-5)   # Absolute value\n  1:100     # Sequence of integers from 1 to 100\n\nThen, these mathematical operations will be carried out in the R Console. Each of them returns the output of the operation — for example, 6 for 1 + 5, and -1 for 2 - 3.\nRecall that R ignores everything after #, so you can annotate your R script after #.\nNext, write 5:100 as follows in your R script and execute it. You will get the output that follows — a sequence of numbers from 5 to 100.\n\n  5:100    # Sequence of integers from 5 to 100\n\n [1]   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23\n[20]  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42\n[39]  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61\n[58]  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80\n[77]  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99\n[96] 100\n\n\nIn the output, numbers in square brackets at the beginning of each line represent a position of the first entry of each line. As you see in the above output, 5 is the first entry of 5:100, and 24 is the 20th entry of 5:100, 43 is the 39th, and so forth.\n\n\n2.3.3 Create a Variable Using the Assignment Operator (&lt;-)\nWe can create a variable and assign a number or multiple numbers to this variable using the assignment operator, &lt;-. First, let’s assign a single number to a variable.\nFor example, the following operation will assign the result of 1 + 5, which is 6, to a variable named y. Write this operation in your R script and then execute it (once again, see Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run a function from within an R script).\n\n  y &lt;- 1 + 5  # The assignment operator, &lt;-, will assign the values on the right-hand-side \n              # to a variable named y.\n\nTyping in the variable name in the R Console will print its content. Try this.\n\n  y\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nIt returns 6.\nNow write the following operation in your R script and execute it to create a different variable x.\n\n  x &lt;- 7\n\nCheck its content by typing the variable name, x, in the R Console.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIt returns 7. You can overwrite a variable by assigning a different number to the variable. Write the following operation in your R script and execute it.\n\n  x &lt;- 10\n\nNow your x should be changed to 10. Type in x in the R Console to confirm.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nYou can apply mathematical operations on variables. For example, write the following operations — sqrt() to take a square root — in your R script and execute them.\n\n  y + x        # Because y = 6 & x = 10, this is 16.\n\n[1] 16\n\n  sqrt(y + x)  # This will take a square root of 16, which is 4.\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nYou may assign the result of a mathematical operation on variables to another variable. Write the following operations in your R script and execute them.\n\n  z &lt;- y + x  # z will be the result of y + x. Since y = 6 and x = 10, z = 16.\n\n  z           # Executing this from your R script is equivalent to typing in `z` into the R Console.\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 See What’s in Your Workspace (= Working Memory): ls() or objects()\nWhat you have created so far (called “objects”) in the current R session have been stored in the R’s working memory, called workspace. You can see what is available in your workspace by executing ls() or objects() without arguments (= nothing in the parentheses). objects() may be more intuitive because anything you construct in R is called an object.\nWrit the following functions in your R script and execute them.\n\n  objects()  # This function will list everything in your workspace.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\n\n  ls()       # This function does the same thing as the objects() function.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\nYou can also see what’s stored in your workspace at the Environment tab at the upper right pane.\n\nNote that everything you created and stored in your workspace will be gone, once you quit R. This is fine, as you can always recreate the objects you created in the current R session easily by running the functions recorded in your R script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Remove a Variable from Your Workspace: remove() or rm()\nIf you want to remove or erase a variable from your workspace, use remove() or its abbreviation rm(). For example, remove(x) or rm(x) will erase x from your workspace. Write the following function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(x)   # This function will remove the variable `x` from your workspace.\n\nType in x in the R Console to see that this variable is not available anymore. The error message will suggest that the variable x cannot be found.\n\n\n2.3.6 Remove Everything: remove(list=ls()) or rm(list=ls())\nIf you want to remove everything from your workspace, you may use the following function. Write this function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(list=ls())  # This will erase everything from your workspace.\n\nRun objects() or ls() to see that everything is gone. character{0} means there is nothing in your workspace.\n\n  ls()\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nMake sure you save your R script. This R script may be used as your reference in your later work.",

You can skip the following. Since this question is no longer asked in the recent versions of RStudio Desktop, you may not see this question when you quit your R session.\nHowever, I want to give the following explanations in case you encounter this question when you quit your R session, because this is a default behaviour of R, which is run quietly behind RStudio. There may be an occasion in which you will see this question.\nBy clicking “Save,” you can save all your R session in a workspace image (.RData file) and can open it the next time you start R.\nHowever, I do NOT recommend using this option. It is much better to record all your work in an R script and replicate all your work by executing the R script.\nUsing R scripts allows you to correct your mistakes easily, and all the steps of your work will be transparent. You may also allow others to replicate your work by running your R script.\nAlways choose “Don’t Save” when you quit R and write an R script instead.",

    "text": "1.2 Use RStudio from JupyterHub\nAs a UofT student, you have an access to JupyterHub. While you can download and install R and RStudio on your computer, you may also use RStudio online from JupyterHub. In this option, you can avoid all the troubles in installing R and RStudio. Especially if you encounter any issues in installing R and RStudio on your computer, this will be a viable alternative.\nIn this section, I explain how to use RStudio online through JupyterHub.\nTo access RStudio from JupyterHub, go to https://datatools.utoronto.ca/ and choose RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Log On” and login using your utorid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, RStudio Server will open on your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use RStudio online.\n\n1.2.1 Prepare for POL232 on JupyterHub\nFirst, I suggest you create a folder for POL232.\nClick “New Folder” in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in a name of the folder. Here I use “POL232.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the new folder appears in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we use the datasets in POL232.RData, we first need to upload this file to RStudio on JupyterHub. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, go to the class Quercus site and download POL232.RData.\nThen, let’s upload POL232.RData to RStudio on JupyterHub.\nClick the “Upload” icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the following pop-up window appears. You first need to choose the target directory, which is a folder to which you upload POL232.RData.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand choose the folder you just created. Here I choose the “POL232” folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, select POL232.RData on your local drive to upload.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate POL232.RData on your local drive and select it. Note that the location of POL232.RData on your local drive is different from mine shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit “OK” to upload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, POL232.RData appears in the folder you created in the lower right pane (the “POL232” folder in my case shown below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can upload other files, if necessary, to RStudio on JupyterHub in the same way.\nFor example, to complete Section 2.2, you may want to upload POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R.\nClick these files in your folder in the lower right pane to open them.

In the example shown below, I save a scatterplot produced by the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R (see Section 2.2.1).\nTo save the scatterplot, first choose “Export” on the Plots tab in the lower right pane and choose “Save as Image”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, choose the folder to which you will save the plot and specify a name of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the “Files” tab in the lower right pane, then you can see that the plot you have saved appears there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files saved in your folder is saved in your cloud account for JupyterHub. They will stay there after you log out, and you can use them when you come back to JupyterHub.\n\n\n1.2.3 Download Output\nYou can also download the files you saved online in RStudio on JupyterHub to your computer.\nCheck the file you want to download, and click “More.” Then, choose “Export” from the pull-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the pop-up window, you may change a file name, if you want. Click “Download” to save the file on your computer locally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R lab sessions during the class time or tutorial sessions, you will be required to upload the R script or some other files that you create during the sessions to the class Querus site. For this purpose, you first need to download these files to your local computer, and then, you will upload these files to Quercus from the local computer.",

There are thousands of packages available. You can see the currently available packages in this list.\nYou can see which packages were already downloaded in your R library in the Packages tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\nYou may also use the library() function without an argument. If you run this function in RStudio, the R packages available tab will appear in the upper left pane.\n\n  library()\n\n\nIf this is the first time you use R, what you see here is the list of default R packages which came together with the installation of R. If we want to use R packages not included in this default list, we first need to download and install them on our computer.\n\n1.4.1 Install Package: install.packages()\nIn POL232, we are going to use a few packages included in tidyverse, a popular collection of multiple R packages. If you download and install tidyverse, multiple packages included therein will be installed on your computer. In particular, we will often use dplyr and ggplot2 from the tidyverse family of packages in this course.\nTo install a package, you can use the install.packages() function.\n\n  install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nOr you may choose Install Packages… from the Tools menu.\n\nThen, type in the name of a package you want in the pop up window, and hit Install.\n\nAnother way to launch the above pop up window is to hit the Install icon () on the Packages tab at the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Load Package to Current R Session: library()\nTo use an R package you installed on your computer, you need to first load this package to your current R session using the library() function. For example, the following function loads all packages in tidyverse.\n\n  library(tidyverse)\n\nWe can now use the functions included in the family of tidyverse packages, including dplyr and ggplot2. These functions are accessible during your current R session.\nIf you quit R and restart an R session, you need to load tidyverse again by the library() function.\nNote that you don’t need to download and install the package you need every time you want to use it — once you have downloaded and installed it, it stays in your computer. You just need to load it into your current R session by the library() function, every time you start R.",

Recall that you don’t need to launch R because RStudio quietly opens R behind its GUI.\nIf you use RStudio on JupyterHub and don’t remember how to use it, see Section 1.2.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Load POL232.RData\n\nMake sure you load POL232.RData into your current R session. If you forget how to load POL232.RData into your current R session, see Section 2.1.3.\nIf you use RStudio on JupyterHub or your own computer, you are likely to have already downloaded and stored POL232.RData in your local folder either on your JupyterHub account or your own computer.\nHowever, if you use RStudio on a lab computer in SS 561, you first need to download POL232.RData from the class Quercus site because everything you saved on the lab computer is gone once you logged out from it.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Prepare R Script\n\nI suggest you write everything you do in RStudio in an R script and run R functions from within the R script. If you need a refresher for R script, read Section 2.2 and Section 2.3.\nFor the current purpose, start a new R script and name it “POL232_Lab#_YourLastName.R” in which # is the number of the current lab session (e.g., POL232_Lab2_YourLastName.R, POL232_Lab3_YourLastName.R).

In this case, you first need to install it. See Section 1.4.1 for how to dowonload and install R packages.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Actually Write R Functions\n\nI suggest you actually write the R functions used below in your R script instead of copying and pasting them. By actually writing them and occasionally making mistakes and correcting them, you can get used to how RStudio works more quickly and effectively.\nIf you simply copy and paste them, you will not learn much about RStudio and will not get used to it.\nIn your R script, leave sufficient descriptions of the functions after the # sign (see Section 2.2.2) so that you can use your R script later as your reference when you conduct analysis using these R functions.\nThese descriptions are notes for yourself. Organize these descriptions/notes so that they are convenient for your futur use.",

    "section": "3.2 Histogram: ggplot() + geom_histogram()",
    "text": "3.2 Histogram: ggplot() + geom_histogram()\nLet’s draw a histogram for the Trudeau thermometer in the Canadian Election Study 2019 (ces2019), which records how a respondent feels about Justin Trudeau, the incumbent prime minister in 2019, on a scale from 0 (coldest feeling) to 100 (warmest feeling).\nWe use the ggplot() function for this purpose.\nRecall that an R function mostly takes the form of function.name(...), and we specify arguments in the ... within the parentheses. A basic syntax of the ggplot() function to draw a histogram is as follows. (Don’t implement the code below, which is intended only to show the syntax of the ggplot function and is not intended to be implemented. You will get an error message if you implement the following code.)\n\n  ggplot(name-of-data-frame, aes(name-of-variable)) + \n      geom_histogram()\n\nFirst, the ggplot function takes two arguments at minimum. (Once again, recall that what a function takes in its parentheses () is called an argument.) The first argument is the name of the data frame that contains the variable we want to visualize, and the second argument is the aes() function. Since the second argument is a function, it also takes arguments. The aes() function takes one argument at minimum, the name of the variable which we want to visualize.\nIn summary, the ggplot function tells R which variable from which data frame we want to visualize.\nThen, the ggplot function should be followed by the geom_histogram() function connected by a plus sign (+). We may also specify arguments for the geom_histogram() function, but it still works without any arguments.\nLet’s try this function. There are two Trudeau thermometers in ces2019: the one asked during the election campaign, truedau_therm_cps, and the other asked after the election, truedau_therm_pes. Here we use the one asked during the campaign, truedeau_therm_cps.\nRun the following function — in particular, write it in your R script and run it from there. See Section 2.2.1 for how to execute R functions from your R script.\nThen, a histogram will appear in the Plots tab at the lower right pane.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) +\n    geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 45 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there is a warning message suggesting that R removed “45 rows containing non-finite values.” What this means is that when it drew this histogram, R removed 45 observations for which trudeau_therm_cps is missing.1\n\nWhile the above simple specification of the ggplot() function can produce the histogram above, it doesn’t look great. We should edit this histogram further such that it looks better. To do this, we may add further functions connected by a plus sign (+) to the ggplot() function and/or specify more arguments to these functions.\nLet’s try what we can do step by step.\n\n3.2.1 Location and Width (or Number) of Bins: boundary, binwidth, bins\nFirst, you may have noticed that the left most bin is centered at 0, and the right most bin is centered at 100, although the value of trudeau_therm_cps ranges from 0 to 100 — i.e., there are no observations with the values smaller than 0 or greater than 100. We may want to adjust the histogram such that the bins are drawn within the possible values of the variable — in this case, between 0 and 100. We can do this by setting the boundary argument in the geom_histogram() function.\nIf you set the boundary argument at the minimum value of the variable — 0 in the current case — then the histogram is adjusted such that the left most bin starts from this minimum value, rather than starting just before this minimum value.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n      geom_histogram(boundary=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the histogram looks slightly better, but you may think that the bin width is too narrow, or equivalently, the number of bins is too many. We can adjust this by specifying either the bin width by the binwidth argument or the number of bins by the bins argument in the geom_histogram() function.\nBelow I use the binwidth argument to specify the width of each bin as 10 points.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n      geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the histogram looks much better.\n\n\n3.2.2 Color of Bins: fill, color\nSuppose you want to change the color of the bins. We can specify the fill argument in the geom_histogram function as below. You may specify the name of the color you want. You can find the color names used in R online, here and here, for example.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the boundaries of each bin are not clear. Let’s draw a line around each bin. We can do this by specifying the color argument in the geom_histogram function. I made these lines black below, but you may of course choose a different color.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Title and Axis Labels: labs(), ylab(), xlab()\nWe can add a title by adding the labs() function, and we can change the axis labels by the ylab() and xlab() functions. Below I added a title that reads “Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU” and changed the Y-axis label from the default “count” to “Number of Observations” and the X-axis label from the default variable name (trudeau_therm_cps) to nothing. Don’t forget to connect all these functions by a plus sign (+).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Values and Tick Marks Appearing on the X and Y Axes: scale_x_continuous(), scale_y_continuous()\nWe can also change the values of the variable on the X-axis at which tick marks and numbers appear by the scale_x_continuous() function with the breaks argument. In the histograms above, the tick marks and numbers appear at 0 to 100 with an interval of 25. Below I change them to 0 to 100 with an interval of 10. For this purpose, the breaks argument is set to seq(0, 100, 10).\nThe seq(starting-number, ending-number, interval) function is another function which produces a sequence of numbers from starting-number to ending-number with the specified interval. That is, seq(0, 100, 10) produces a sequence from 0 to 100 with an interval of 10.\nAs you can see in the X-axis of the histogram below, setting breaks = seq(0, 100, 10) in the scale_x_continuous function (the last line of the code below) changes the values and tick marks at the X-axis to 0 to 100 with an interval of 10.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry other values to see how the values and tick marks change on the X-axis. For example, if you change this to seq(20, 60, 20) (the last line of the code below), then the values and tick marks appear only from 20 to 60 with an interval of 20.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 60, 20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the values and tick marks on the Y-axis, we can add the scale_y_continuous function with the same breaks argument. Below I change the values and tick marks to 0 to 1000 with an interval of 200 (the last line).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, 200))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Range of Values at the X and Y Axes: coord_cartesian()\nWe can also change the range of values appearing on both X and Y axes by adding the coord_cartesian() function with the xlim and ylim arguments, respectively. In the code below at the last line, I added coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1200)) to change the range of values on the Y-axis to the range between 0 and 1200. Accordingly, I also changed the ending value of the breaks argument in the scale_y_continuous function to 1200 (the second to the last line).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, 200)) +\n    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as an example, I also added the xlim argument to the coord_cartesian() function below (the last line) to shorten the range of X-axis.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, 200)) +\n    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1200), xlim = c(20,80))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can draw a pretty nice histogram for the variable of your interest.",

Let’s compute the mean and median of a variable using RStudio. We use the mean() and median() functions, respectively.\n\n3.5.1 Compute Mean and Median: mean(), median()\nLet’s compute the mean of the variable trudeau_therm_cps. The mean() function takes a variable name as their argument.\nAs trudeau_therm_cps is one column of the data frame ces2019, we need to use $ to access it — more specifically, we can refer to trudeau_therm_cps as ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps.\nIf you type in ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps in the R Console (try this), R will print the values of this variable (or the corresponding column of ces2019) in the Console. In general, the syntax to access a variable in a data frame is name-of-data-frame$name-of-variable. We connect the name of the data frame and the name of the variable by a dollar sign ($).\nThe mean() function takes the name of a variable specified this way as their argument. In addition, we should specify another argument, na.rm, as shown below.\n\n  mean(ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 43.71655\n\n\nHere, na.rm means “remove NA.”\nIn R’s data frame, all missing values are recorded as NA.

You can find the names of the line types used in R online, for example, here.\n\n  hist_trudeau2 &lt;- hist_trudeau + \n    geom_vline(xintercept = 43.72, linetype =  \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 50, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"blue\")\n  print(hist_trudeau2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the above code, we created a new object hist_trudeau2, which updates the ggplot() functions in hist_trudeau with the geom_vline() function, and then used the print() function to draw this new histogram.",

This function annotates a histogram with several different elements, one of which is texts. To add texts to our histogram, we specify the first argument of the annotate() function as \"text\". The function also takes the x and y arguments, which specifies the location of the texts, and the label argument, which specifies the content of the texts we want to add. The values of the x and y arguments are from the values of the X-axis (the horizontal axis) and the Y-axis (the vertical axis) of the histogram we have drawn. Recall that in our histogram about the Justin Trudeau thermometer variable, the values of the Y-axis range from 0 to 1200 and those of the X-axis range from 0 to 100. Based on these values, the x and y arguments determine the location of the center of the texts. I also added the color argument to specify the text color.\n\n  hist_trudeau3 &lt;- hist_trudeau2 +   \n    annotate(\"text\", x = 80, y = 1100, label = \"Mean = 43.72\", color = \"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 80, y =  900, label = \"Median = 50\", color = \"blue\")\n  print(hist_trudeau3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, I tried other values for the x and y arguments to demonstrate how the texts move.

    "section": "4.2 Bar Chart: ggplot() + geom_bar() & Edit Variables",
    "text": "4.2 Bar Chart: ggplot() + geom_bar() & Edit Variables\nIn Chapter 3, we learned how to draw a histogram using the ggplot() function.\nA histogram is an appropriate visualization if the variable of interest takes many values and/or is continuous. If the variable takes only a small number of values and/or is categorical, a bar chart may be more appropriate. Let’s draw a bar chart for the variable on the respondent’s perception of economy (percep_economy_cps) from the Canadian Election Study 2019 (ces2019).\nTo draw a bar chart, we augment the ggplot() function with the geom_bar() function (as opposed to the geom_histogram() function we used to draw a histogram).\nFirst, try the simplest implementation of these functions as shown below.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(percep_economy_cps)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply many of the additional arguments and functions we learned for a histogram to a bar chart. Let’s see an example.\n\n  bar_econ &lt;- ggplot(ces2019, aes(percep_economy_cps)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Perception of Economy\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\")\n  print(bar_econ)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the above code, I assigned the ggplot() functions for a bar chart to a new object bar_econ and then used the print() function to draw it.\nTry to identify what each line of the above code accomplishes. If you need a refresher, see Chapter 3. You can also use a keyword search over the entire webbook from the left menu.\nBy the way, as we saw in Section 3.4, instead of using the print()function, you can also simply type in bar_econ in the R Console to run the ggplot() functions assigned to bar_econ.\n\n  bar_econ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Change Angle of Value Labels on X Axis: theme(), axis.text.x, element_text()\nIn the X-axis of the above bar chart, notice that the names of the categories (or values) of the variable cannot be read because of an overlap. This is because the names are too long to be properly displayed in a horizontal direction.\nWe can change the angle of the names of the categories (or values) of a variable (= value labels of a variable) by the theme function as shown below.\n\n  bar_econ +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you specify a different number to angle, then value labels are presented in a different angle. For example, try the following.\n\n  bar_econ +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may want to edit this bar chart further. First, instead of “Better,” “Worse,” and “About the Same” in the above bar chart, we may want to re-order them from “Worse,” “About the Same” to “Better.” Second, we may want to change the name of the categories — more specifically, we may want to remove the numbers and parentheses and shorten the name from “About the same” to “same.” Third, we may want to remove “NA” from the bar chart.\nWe will do these edits one by one.\n\n\n4.2.2 NA: Missing Observations\nBy the way, NA indicates the observations for which the variable of interest is missing. We call such observations “missing observations” and those NAs “missing values.”\nTo know more about missing observations, browse ces2019 using the View() function or clicking ces2019 in the Environment tab on the upper right pane.\n\n  View(ces2019)\n\nThen, you can find that for some observations, the values of some variables are NA, as shown below. These entries (NAs) indicate that the values of these variables are missing for these observations.\n\nThe ggplot() + geom_bar() functions include these missing observations in the bar chart they draw. However, we may want to exclude these missing observations from the bar chart.\n\n\n4.2.3 Factor for Categorical Variables: glimpse()\nDepending on their characteristics, variables in a data frame may be stored in different formats in R. Normally, our dataset includes both quantitative (or numeric) variables, which take numbers (numerical values), and categorical variables, which take a set of categories. Of the variables from ces2019 that we have examined so far, the Trudeau thermometer (truedeau_therm_cps) is a quantitative (or numeric) variable, as it takes a number between 0 and 100. Respondent’s perception of the state of the national economy (percep_economy_cps) is a categorical variable, as it takes three categories indicating the respondents’ perception of economy. These two types of variables are stored in different formats in a data frame.\nTo see different formats for variables, try the glimpse() function below with the name of a data frame as its argument.\n\n  glimpse(ces2019)\n\n\n\nRows: 4,021\nColumns: 5\n$ sample_id         &lt;dbl&gt; 18, 32, 39, 59, 61, 69, 157, 158, 165, 167, 185, 220…\n$ birth_year        &lt;dbl&gt; 1963, 1973, 1994, 2000, 1984, 1939, 1999, 1995, 1963…\n$ gender            &lt;fct&gt; (1) Male, (1) Male, (1) Male, (1) Male, (1) Male, (1…\n$ province          &lt;fct&gt; QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, QC, …\n$ satisfied_dem_cps &lt;fct&gt; (3) Not very satisfied, (2) Fairly satisfied, (1) Ve…\n\n\nYour R Console prints a list like the one above for all variables in ces2019. For brevity, I printed only the first five variables above. As its name suggests, the glimpse() function offers a glimpse into your data frame — names of variables, their format, and the values of the first few observations.\nIn this list, you can see that the format1 of the variables are either &lt;dbl&gt; or &lt;fct&gt;.\n&lt;dbl&gt; is for numeric (or quantitative) variables,2 for which each value is number, and &lt;fct&gt; is for categorical variables, which is stored in a format called factor. For example, sample_id and birth_year are numbers (numeric variables), hence they are given &lt;dbl&gt; in the list above. gender, province, and satisfied_dem_cps are categorical variables, and the list above indicates &lt;fct&gt; for these variables. A factor is a special format for categorical variables in R, which offers convenient functionalities for this type of variable. We will use these functionalities of factor to edit percep_eonomy_cps.\n\n\n4.2.4 Create New Variable: mutate(), head()\nSuppose we want to create a new variable for which the order of categories of percep_economy_cps will appear from “Worse,” “Same” to “Better” when we draw a bar chart.\nWe will create such a variable step by step in the next few sections.\nIn this section, I will explain how we can create a new variable in our data frame. For simplicity, we will create a new variable percep_economy_cps_copy which is exactly the same as percep_economy_cps. We can do this by the mutate() function.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n              percep_economy_cps_copy = percep_economy_cps)\n\nThe first argument of the mutate() function is the data frame to which we want to add a new variable. Its second argument specifies the content of this new variable by name-of-new-variable = its-content. In the above code, it is specified that the new variable percep_economy_cps_copy equals percep_economy_cps.\nThe right hand side of &lt;- (the assignment operator3, see Section 2.3.3) in the above code mutated the data frame ces2019 by adding a new variable percep_economy_cps_copy. Then, this new, mutated data frame is assigned to ces2019 on the left hand side of &lt;-. In other words, ces2019 is now updated with an additional variable percep_economy_cps_copy.\nCheck if the new variable percep_economy_cps_copy is added to your data frame using the glimpse() function. If you apply the glimpse() function to ces2019, now you can see this new variable percep_economy_cps_copy at the end of the data frame. For brevity, I show only percep_economy_cps and percep_economy_cps_copy below. They are exactly the same.\n\n  glimpse(ces2019)\n\n\n\nRows: 4,021\nColumns: 2\n$ percep_economy_cps      &lt;fct&gt; (2) Worse, (3) About the same, (1) Better, (3)…\n$ percep_economy_cps_copy &lt;fct&gt; (2) Worse, (3) About the same, (1) Better, (3)…\n\n\nWe can also use the head() function to see the first few observations of a variable. Try the code below.\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps)\n\n[1] (2) Worse          (3) About the same (1) Better         (3) About the same\n[5] (1) Better         (2) Worse         \nLevels: (1) Better (2) Worse (3) About the same\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps_copy)\n\n[1] (2) Worse          (3) About the same (1) Better         (3) About the same\n[5] (1) Better         (2) Worse         \nLevels: (1) Better (2) Worse (3) About the same\n\n\nAs you can see, the values for each observation are exactly the same between percep_economy_cps and percep_economy_cps_copy.\nBy specifying the right hand side of = in the second argument of the mutate() function in different ways, we can create different types of new variables.\nThe mutate() function may also be used to edit the existing variables in our data frame.\nWe will see a few examples in this chapter and subsequent chapters.\n\n\n4.2.5 Change Levels and Their Order of Factor: levels(), fct_relevel()\nLet’s explore the characteristics of factor a little further.\nWhen categorical variables are stored as factor in R, they are associated with levels, which represent the name of each category, such as “(1) Better” and “(2) Worse”, and assigns a specific order to these categories.\nYou can find levels of categorical variables stored as factor by the levels() function with the name of the variable as its argument.\nRecall that as percep_economy_cps is one column of the data frame ces2019, we use $ to access it — more specifically, we refer to percep_economy_cps as ces2019$percep_economy_cps.\n\n  levels(ces2019$percep_economy_cps)\n\n[1] \"(1) Better\"         \"(2) Worse\"          \"(3) About the same\"\n\n\nThe output lists the three categories, or levels, taken by percep_economy_cps. Also, these levels are associated with the order that appears above. So, if we draw a bar chart of this variable, bars are ordered by this order associated with levels.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(percep_economy_cps)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Perception of Economy\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBars appeared from “(1) Better”, “(2) Worse”, to “(3) About the same”. To change the order of bars, we need to change the order of levels for percep_econ_cps. We can do this by the fct_relevel() function.\nA basic syntax of the fct_relevel() function is the following. Don’t execute the code below because it is not intended to be implemented; it is used only to show the syntax of this R function.\n\n      fct_relevel( factor_variable, \n          \"First Level\", \"Second Level\", \"Third Level\")\n\nThe first argument of the fct_relevel() function is the categorical variable stored as factor that we want to “relevel” (i.e., change the order of categories).\nThen, it is followed by the levels or categories of this variable in the order we want.\nBelow, I use the mutate() function to create a new variable percep_economy_cps2 in which percep_economy_cps is releveled or reordered.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n      percep_economy_cps2 = fct_relevel(percep_economy_cps, \n          \"(2) Worse\", \"(3) About the same\", \"(1) Better\") )\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, the mutate() function on the right hand side of &lt;- creates a new variable percep_economy_cps2 in the data frame ces2019. In its second argument, the fct_relevel() function is used to specify the content of the new variable. By this fct_relevel() function, percep_economy_cps2 equals percep_economy_cps but with different ordering of its levels or categories. The order of the levels or categories of percep_economy_cps2 is now from “(2) Worse” to “(3) About the same” to “(1) Better”.\nBy the above code, ces2019 is now updated with an additional variable percep_economy_cps2, with the desired order of its levels or categories. Let’s check that the new variable percep_economy_cps2 is releveled or reordered as we wanted using the levels() function.\n\n  levels(ces2019$percep_economy_cps2)\n\n[1] \"(2) Worse\"          \"(3) About the same\" \"(1) Better\"        \n\n\nThe variable is indeed releveled or reordered as we specified.\nLet’s draw a bar chart for this releveled variable.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(percep_economy_cps2)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Perception of Economy\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the bars appeared in the order we wanted.\n\n\n4.2.6 Change Names of Categories/Levels: fct_recode()\nNext we will remove numbers, such as (1) and (2), from each category of percep_economy_cps2 and change “About the Same” to “Same.” Specifically, we will create a new variable named percep_economy_cps3 with our desired names of levels or categories of percep_economy_cps2. For this purpose, we use the fct_recode() function. A basic syntax of the fct_recode() function is as follows. Once again, don’t implement the code below, as it is not intended to be implemented; it is used only to show a syntax of this R function.\n\nfct_recode(factor_variable, \n              \"New Name of Level 1\" = \"Original Name of Level 1\", \n              \"New Name of Level 2\" = \"Original Name of Level 2\", \n              \"New Name of Level 3\" = \"Original Name of Level 3\") \n\nLet’s create a new variable percep_economy_cps3 using this function.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n      percep_economy_cps3 = fct_recode(percep_economy_cps2, \n                                \"Worse\" = \"(2) Worse\", \n                                \"Same\" = \"(3) About the same\", \n                                \"Better\" = \"(1) Better\") )\n\nThis code adds a new variable percep_eocnomy_cps3 to ces2019. The first argument of the fct_recode() function above is the name of the variable whose levels or categories are changed (precep_economy_cps2). The following arguments specify the new name of each level and the old name of each level.\nLet’s check the levels of percep_economy_cps3 by the levels() function to see whether the names of levels or categories were changed as specified.\n\n  levels(ces2019$percep_economy_cps3)\n\n[1] \"Worse\"  \"Same\"   \"Better\"\n\n\nThe names of levels or categories were indeed changed as we wanted.\nLet’s draw a histogram using this new variable.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(percep_economy_cps3)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Perception of Economy\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart looks much better now. Note that we didn’t need to use theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) anymore in the above code, because the names of categories are short enough to appear horizontally.\n\n\n4.2.7 Remove NA: drop_na()\nNow we will remove NA from the bar chart. For this purpose, we use the drop_na() function. A basic syntax of the drop_na() function is this (the code below is not intended to be implemented).\n\n  drop_na(name_of_data_frame, name_of_variable)\n\nThe first argument is the name of the data frame from which we want to remove missing observations, and the second argument is the name of the variable for which we want to eliminate missing observations.\nIn other words, the drop_na() function looks for the observations for which the variable in the second argument is missing (NA) and removes these observations from the data frame in the first argument.\nTherefore, if we specify the drop_na() function as below, then the drop_na() function looks for the observations in ces2019 for which percep_economy_cps3 is missing (NA), and removes these observations from ces2019.\n\n  drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps3)\n\nTo draw a bar chart of percep_economy_cps3, we may replace ces2019 in the first argument of the ggplot() function with drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps3). In this way, the ggplot() function will use a version of ces2019 from which the observations with percep_economy_cps3 missing are removed. Let’s try this.\n\n  ggplot(drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps3), aes(percep_economy_cps3)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"dodgerblue\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Perception of Economy\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we were able to draw a bar chart without NA.",

    "text": "4.3 Computing Summary Statistics\n\n4.3.1 Standard Deviation and IQR: sd(), IQR()\nIn Chapter 3, we computed the mean and the median of a variable using the mean() and median() functions. Here I introduce the sd() and IQR() functions to compute the standard deviation and IQR of a variable.\nA basic syntax of the sd() and IQR() functions is the same as the mean() and median() functions. The first argument of these functions is the variable for which we want to compute this summary statistic. We should also specify na.rm = TRUE (na.rm stands for “remove NA”). Otherwise, these functions do not compute the summary statistics if there are missing observations for the specified variable.\nBelow I compute the standard deviation and IQR for the Trudeau thermometer variable (trudeau_therm_cps) in ces2019.\n\n  sd(ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 30.68348\n\n\n\n  IQR(ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 60\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the Trudeau thermometer (trudeau_therm_cps) is approximately 31, and its IQR is 60.\n\n\n4.3.2 Mode for Categorical Variables\nNote that the mean(), median(), sd(), and IQR() functions work for quantitative or numeric variables, such as trudeau_therm_cps, but do not work for categorical variables or factors, such as percep_economy_cps. Let’s try the mean() function for percep_economy_cps.\nWe will get NA and an error message saying that we cannot compute this summary statistic for categorical variables or factors.\n\n  mean(ces2019$percep_economy_cps, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nWarning in mean.default(ces2019$percep_economy_cps, na.rm = TRUE): argument is\nnot numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nIn fact, while these summary statistics are useful and appropriate for quantitative or numeric variables, they may not be useful or appropriate for categorical variables.\nEspecially for nominal, categorical variables, neither the mean nor the median makes sense. For example, consider the variable on individual’s vote intention, in which the possible choices are Liberals, Conservative, NDP, BQ, Greens, and others. It is impossible to conceptualize the average of this variable. As there is no natural order among these choices, we cannot conceptualize the median for this variable, either. Instead, an appropriate summary statistic for the center of distribution for nominal, categorical variables like this one is the mode.\nThe mode is also an appropriate summary of the center of distribution for ordinal categorical variables. In addition, the median is useful for ordinal variables, because there is a natural order among the categories of this type of variables.\nThe mode of a categorical variable may easily be identified from a bar chart. Consider the bar chart of percep_economy_cps that we drew above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the mode is the category with the largest number of observations, we can easily identify “Same” as the mode for this variable.\n\n\n4.3.3 Median for Ordinal Catagorical Variables — Change Factor to Numeric: as.numeric()\npercep_economy_cps is an ordinal, categorical variable because there is a natural order among each category from “Worse” to “Same” to “Better.” Therefore, we may also want to find the median for this variable. As we have seen, however, the median() function does not work for a categorical variable stored as a factor. Therefore, to apply the median() function to an ordinal, categorical variable, we first need to transform the categorical variable stored as a factor to a numeric variable. We use the as.numeric() function for this purpose. We specify the name of the variable which we want to transform to a numeric variable as the argument for the as.numeric() function.\nLet’s create a numeric version of percep_economy_cps using the mutate() and the as.numeric() functions. In the code below, I call the new variable percep_ceonomy_cps_n, in which n stands for a numeric variable.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n                  percep_economy_cps_n = as.numeric(percep_economy_cps3))\n\nLet’s compare percep_economy_cps3 and percep_economy_cps_n. Below I show the first few observations of each variable, respectively, by the glimpse() function.\n\n  glimpse(ces2019)\n\n\n\nRows: 4,021\nColumns: 2\n$ percep_economy_cps3  &lt;fct&gt; Worse, Same, Better, Same, Better, Worse, NA, Bet…\n$ percep_economy_cps_n &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, NA, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, …\n\n\nYou may also use the head() function to check the first few observations of percep_economy_cps3 and percep_economy_cps_n.\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps3)\n\n[1] Worse  Same   Better Same   Better Worse \nLevels: Worse Same Better\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps_n)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 2 3 1\n\n\nAs you can see above, now each category is replaced by numbers from 1 to 3 in percep_economy_cps_n. More specifically, percep_economy_cps_n equals 1 for “Worse”, 2 for “Same”, and 3 for “Better.”\nThese numbers correspond to the order of categories or levels in percep_economy_cps3. Let’s check the order of levels in percep_economy_cps.\n\n  levels(ces2019$percep_economy_cps3)\n\n[1] \"Worse\"  \"Same\"   \"Better\"\n\n\nAs demonstrated in this example, if we apply the as.numeric() function to a categorical variable stored as a factor to transform it to a numeric variable, the numbers that appear in the resulting variable is in the order of the levels of the original categorical variable stored as a factor.\nSince percep_economy_cps_n is a numeric variable, we can apply the functions for summary statistics for numeric variables. For example, we can use the median() function to find the median category for percep_economy_cps_n.\n\n  median(ces2019$percep_economy_cps_n, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThe median we got above is 2. Since percep_economy_cps_n = 2 if percep_economy_cps3 = “Same,” the median of the perception of economy is “Same.”",

    "text": "4.4 Box Plot: geom_boxplot()\nIn this section, we are going to use the ipe2015 dataset. We will draw a box plot of trade_WDI, which is a volume of trade (export + import) as % of GDP across countries around the world.\nTo draw a box plot, we add the geom_boxplot() function to the ggplot() function. Below is the simplest implementation without any arguments for the geom_boxplot() function.\n\n  ggplot(ipe2015, aes(trade_WDI)) + \n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the default option of the geom_boxplot() function produces a horizontal box plot. Let’s change it to a vertical box plot. For this purpose, we should specify y = trade_WDI in the aes() function inside the ggplot() function. This instructs the ggplot() function that the values of trade_WDI should appear in the vertical or y axis.\n\n  ggplot(ipe2015, aes(y = trade_WDI)) +              # Add \"y =\". \n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box in this boxplot may be too wide. It would look better if we can make it thinner. Below I added two new arguments: x = factor(0) in the aes() function and width = 0.2 in the geom_boxplot() function. The width argument in the geom_boxplot() function controls the width of the box. To let this argument work, you also need to specify x = factor(0) in the aes() function. You may change the width of the box further by specifying a different value for the width argument for the geom_boxplot function. I’d suggest you try a few different values to see how the box width changes.\n\n  ggplot(ipe2015, aes(y = trade_WDI, x = factor(0))) +  # Add x = factor(0). \n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)                           # Specify the width argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs suggested in the lecture, a default length of whisker is 1.5 times IQR. While this length of whisker looks good to this box plot, let’s change it to see how it appears differently. For this purpose, we specify the coef argument in the geom_boxplot() function. We specify the number of times of IQR that we want for the length of whisker in the coef argument. Below, I specify it at 3. Then, the length of whisker to be drawn is 3 times IQR.\n\n  ggplot(ipe2015, aes(y = trade_WDI, x = factor(0))) +  \n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, coef = 3)       # Add the coef argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the length of the upper whisker is longer than before, and the two outliers that appeared above the upper whisker disappeared because these outliers are now behind the upper whisker. I’d suggest you try a few different values to see how the length of whisker changes.\nPerhaps, you noticed that the length of the lower whisker didn’t change. Moreover, in the original box plot where we didn’t specify the coef argument and therefore, we used the default length of 1.5 times IQR, the length of the lower whisker was shorter than the length of the upper whisker, or 1.5 times IQR. This is because the lower (or upper) whisker extends only to the minimum (or maximum) value of a variable. In other words, the minimum value of trade_WDI is within 1.5 times IQR, and therefore, the lower whisker was shorter than the upper whisker in the original box plot, and its length didn’t change when we changed the length of whisker to 3 by the coef argument.\nWe can further edit the box plot using the functions we learned in Chapter 3. (I don’t use the coef argument here because 1.5 times IQR seems to be reasonable for this variable.)\n\n  trade_box &lt;- ggplot(ipe2015, aes(y = trade_WDI, x = factor(0))) + \n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill=\"cyan4\") +\n    labs(title = \"Trade (% of GDP)\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"\")\n  print(trade_box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the above code, I assigned the ggplot() + geom_boxplot() functions to a new object trade_box and then used the print() function to draw the box plot.\nYou may want to remove 0 on the horizontal axis. We can do this by specifying the axis.text.x argument for the theme() function as follows. Recall that trade_box includes all ggplot() + geom_boxplot() functions assigned above, and we can add additional functions to trade_box.\n\n  trade_box +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may further want to remove the tick mark on the horizontal axis. We can do this by specifying the axis.ticks.x argument for the theme() function as follows.\n\n  trade_box +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n         axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow this box plot looks pretty good.\nA box plot may also be drawn horizontally. I suggest you identify what is different in the following code for a horizontal box plot from the previous code for a vertical box plot.\n\n  ggplot(ipe2015, aes(x = trade_WDI, y = factor(0))) + \n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill=\"cyan4\") +\n    labs(title = \"Trade (% of GDP)\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"\") +\n    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.y = element_blank())",

    "text": "5.1.1 Prepare the percep_economy_cps Variable\nWe are going to draw a mosaic plot for satisfied_fedgovt and percep_economy_cps from the ces2019 data frame. This can be considered as a simple test of the theory of economic voting. In this analysis, percep_economy_cps is the independent variable, and satisfied_fedgovt is the dependent variable.\nBefore visualizing the relationship, we first edit percep_economy_cps. Recall what we did for percep_economy_cps in Section 4.2. We change the names of their categories or levels to simpler ones (Section 4.2.6) and change the order of the categories or levels (Section 4.2.5).\nTo change the names of the categories or levels, we use the fct_recode() function (Section 4.2.6). Recall its basic syntax. (Don’t execute the following code, which is intended to show you the syntax only.)\n\nfct_recode(factor_variable, \n              \"New Name of Level 1\" = \"Original Name of Level 1\", \n              \"New Name of Level 2\" = \"Original Name of Level 2\", \n              \"New Name of Level 3\" = \"Original Name of Level 3\") \n\nTo change the order of categories or levels, we use the fct_relevel() function (Section 4.2.5). Recall the following basic syntax. (Once again, don’t run the following code, which is intended to show you the syntax only.)\n\n      fct_relevel(factor_variable, \n          \"First Level\", \"Second Level\", \"Third Level\")\n\nLet’s edit precep_economy_cps using these functions. In Section 4.2, we created a new variable to reflect the edits, but here we instead update percep_economy_cps with these edits. In the following code, the left hand side of = in the mutate() function is percep_economy_cps instead of precep_economy_cps2 or percep_economy_cps3 used in the previous lab session. In this way, we can update the content of percep_economy_cps.\n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,\n  percep_economy_cps = fct_recode(percep_economy_cps,\n    \"Worse\" = \"(2) Worse\",\n    \"Same\" = \"(3) About the same\",\n    \"Better\" = \"(1) Better\") )\n\n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,\n  percep_economy_cps = fct_relevel(percep_economy_cps,\n    \"Worse\", \"Same\", \"Better\") )\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Draw a Raw Mosaic Plot: mosaicplot()\nLet’s draw a mosaic plot for percep_economy_cps and satisfied_fedgovt.\nIn POL232 in the past years, I used the ggmosaic package, which works with theggplot() function, so that you could apply the functions you have learned to edit visualizations produced by the ggplot() functions.\nUnfortunately, however, the ggmosaic package is currently not available. Therefore, I will introduce the mosaicplot() function this year. As we cannot use the functions to edit visualizations produced by the ggplot() function for the mosaic plot produced by the mosaiplot() function, I will also introduce several arguments to edit this mosaic plot.\nBelow is the syntax for the minimum specification for the mosaicplot() function. (Don’t run the following code, which is intended to show you the syntax only.)\n\nmosaicplot(~ independent_variable + dependent_variable, \n                  # \"~\" followed by the name of independent variable \n                  #            \"+\" name of dependent variable\n            data = nama_of_data_frame \n                  # Specify the name of the data frame in the data argument \n        )\n\n\nLet’s appy this minimum specification to percep_conomy_cps and satisfied_fedgovt from ces2019.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this doesn’t appear aesthetically, we need to edit its appearance. Let’s do this step by step.\n\n\n5.1.3 Edit the satisfied_fedgovt Variable\nAs we have already edited the name of categories (or levels) for percep_economy_cps, its category names appear nicely in the above mosaic plot. However, we should also edit the name of categories (or levels) for satisfied_fedgovt as its names seem to be too long.\nFirst, check the current category names (or levels) of satisfied_fedgovt.\n\n  levels(ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt)\n\n[1] \"(1) Very satisfied\"       \"(2) Fairly satisfied\"    \n[3] \"(3) Not very satisfied\"   \"(4) Not satisfied at all\"\n\n\nThen, let’s change the name of categories of satisfied_fedgovt using the fct_recode function.\n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,\n  satisfied_fedgovt = fct_recode(satisfied_fedgovt,\n    \"Not At All\" = \"(4) Not satisfied at all\",\n    \"Not Very\" = \"(3) Not very satisfied\",\n    \"Fairly\" = \"(2) Fairly satisfied\",\n    \"Very\" = \"(1) Very satisfied\") )\n\nLet’s see whether we have successfully change their names.\n\n  levels(ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt)\n\n[1] \"Very\"       \"Fairly\"     \"Not Very\"   \"Not At All\"\n\n\nDraw a mosaic plot applying the mosaicplot() function to new satisfied_fedgovt.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Edit the Mosaic Plot Drawn by mosaicplot()\nNow I will introduce several arguments to edit the mosaic plot produced by the mosaicplot() function. These arguments can be used in any default R graphic functions which can be used without loading an additional package — these default functions are also called base R functions. However, they don’t work with the ggplot() function.\nFirst, let’s change the plot title, which currently appears as “ces2019.” We can do this by specifying the main argument within the mosaicplot() function. Below I changed the plot title to “Economic Voting.”\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"Economic Voting\")  # Change the plot title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also remove the plot tile entirely by specifying an empty string for the main argument.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"\")  # Erase the plot title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso change the variable labels on the horizontal and vertical axes. We can do this by specifying the xlab argument for the horizontal axis and the ylab argument for the vertical axis in the mosaicplot() function.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"\",\n              xlab = \"Perception of Economy\",     # Change the label at x-axis.\n              ylab = \"Satisfied with Government\") # Change the label at y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe categories on the vertical axis may be easier to read if they are presented horizontally. We can do this by specifying the las argument at 1.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"\",\n              xlab = \"Perception of Economy\",     \n              ylab = \"Satisfied with Government\",\n              las = 1)  # Print y-axis labels horizontally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify the colors of the mosaic tiles by adding the color argument. Recall that you can look up the names of the colors used in R online, for example, here and here.\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + satisfied_fedgovt,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"\",\n              xlab = \"Perception of Economy\",     \n              ylab = \"Satisfied with Government\",\n              las = 1,\n              color = c(\"steelblue4\", \"steelblue3\",  # Change tile colors\n                          \"steelblue1\", \"lightsteelblue2\"))",

    "section": "5.2 Cross Tabulation",
    "text": "5.2 Cross Tabulation\nA mosaic plot is a wonderful visualization, but we may also want to know the actual proportions of each tile. For this purpose, we may use R to produce a cross tabulation (or a crosstab). One way to do this requires two steps. First, we use the table() function to produce a cross tabulation in terms of the number of observations. Then, we apply the prop.table() function to transform the output of the table() function to the crosstab in terms of proportion or percentage.\n\n5.2.1 Cross Tabulation in Number of Observations: table()\nA basic syntax of the table() function is as follows.\n\n  table(variable_in_rows, variable_in_columns)\n\nIn other words, the first argument of the table() function is the variable that will appear in the rows, and the second argument is the variable in the columns. For the current purpose of examining the theory of economic voting, we want our dependent variable to appear in rows and independent variable in columns. Hence, the basic syntax of the table() function may also be written as below.\n\n  table(dependent_variable, independent_variable)\n\nLet’s apply this function to percep_economy_cps and satisfied_fedgovt.\n\n  table(ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt,   # table(dependent_variable, independent_variable)\n        ces2019$percep_economy_cps)\n\n            \n             Worse Same Better\n  Very          17   67    100\n  Fairly       214  836    483\n  Not Very     399  554    178\n  Not At All   673  275     47\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the categories of the dependent variable appear in rows in the order of the categories (or levels) from top to bottom.\n\n\n5.2.2 Cross Tabulation in Proportion: prop_table()\nSince the crosstab derived above is in number of observations, let’s convert it to one in terms of proportion. We can do this by using the prop.table() function with the output of the table() function as its argument.\nFor this purpose, first assign the output of the table() function to a new object called tab.\n\n    # Use the assignment operator (\"&lt;-\") to assign the output of the table() function \ntab &lt;- table( ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt,   # to a new object named \"tab.\" \n              ces2019$percep_economy_cps )   \n\nThen, use the prop.table() function as below.\n\n      # The first argument of prop.table() is the output of the table() function.\n      # The second argument specifies the type of proportion to be derived.\n  prop.table(tab, 2)  # The second argument 2 = column proportions are calculated.\n\n            \n                  Worse       Same     Better\n  Very       0.01304682 0.03868360 0.12376238\n  Fairly     0.16423638 0.48267898 0.59777228\n  Not Very   0.30621642 0.31986143 0.22029703\n  Not At All 0.51650038 0.15877598 0.05816832\n\n\nAbove we derived the crosstab in terms of proportion. The second argument of the prop.table() function specifies the type of proportion to be derived. If this is 2, the prop.table() function calculates column proportions — if we add up the proportions within each column, they will sum to one. This is what we want for our present purpose.\nBut we can also compute row proportions — if we add up the proportions within each row, they will sum to one. We can do this by specifying 1 in the second argument of the prop.table() function.\n\n  prop.table(tab, 1)  # The second argument 1 = row proportions are calculated.\n\n            \n                  Worse       Same     Better\n  Very       0.09239130 0.36413043 0.54347826\n  Fairly     0.13959556 0.54533594 0.31506849\n  Not Very   0.35278515 0.48983201 0.15738285\n  Not At All 0.67638191 0.27638191 0.04723618\n\n\nWithout the second argument, the prop.table() function calculates cell proportions — if we add up the proportions of all of the cells, they will sum to one.\n\n  prop.table(tab) # Without second argument = cell proportions are calculated.\n\n            \n                   Worse        Same      Better\n  Very       0.004423627 0.017434296 0.026021337\n  Fairly     0.055685662 0.217538381 0.125683060\n  Not Very   0.103825137 0.144158210 0.046317981\n  Not At All 0.175123601 0.071558678 0.012230029\n\n\nFor our current purpose, what we need is column proportions, therefore, we specify 2 for the second argument of the prop.table() function.\n\n\n5.2.3 Add Column (or Row) Totals to Crosstab\nSince we computed the column proportions, we may also want to add the column totals, which must be 1 for all columns, for clarity. We can use the addmargins() function for this purpose.\nWe assign the output of the prop.table() function to a new object, and use this new object as the first argument of the addmargins() function.\nIn the code below, I assign the output of the prop.table() function to a new object, called ptab, and use ptab as the first argument of the addmargins() function. The second argument of the addmargins() function is specified at 1, which instructs R to compute total of values for each column, or equivalently, across rows.\n\n# Use the assignment operator (\"&lt;-\") to assign the output of \n# the prop.table() function to a new object named \"ptab.\" \n  ptab &lt;- prop.table(tab, 2)\n\n# The second argument of the addmargins() function is 1 \n#       = values are summed up across rows = total for each column.\n  addmargins(ptab, 1) \n\n            \n                  Worse       Same     Better\n  Very       0.01304682 0.03868360 0.12376238\n  Fairly     0.16423638 0.48267898 0.59777228\n  Not Very   0.30621642 0.31986143 0.22029703\n  Not At All 0.51650038 0.15877598 0.05816832\n  Sum        1.00000000 1.00000000 1.00000000\n\n\nAs you can see, column totals are 1 for all columns. Adding column totals makes it clear that what we have in our crosstab are column proportions.\nAs you may expect, if we specify the second argument of the addmargins() function at 2, R will calculate total of values for each row, or equivalently, across columns.\n\n# The second argument of the addmargins() function is 2 \n#       = values are summed up across columns = total for each row.\n  addmargins(ptab, 2) \n\n            \n                  Worse       Same     Better        Sum\n  Very       0.01304682 0.03868360 0.12376238 0.17549279\n  Fairly     0.16423638 0.48267898 0.59777228 1.24468764\n  Not Very   0.30621642 0.31986143 0.22029703 0.84637489\n  Not At All 0.51650038 0.15877598 0.05816832 0.73344468\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Round Values in Crosstab\nIn the above crosstab, the values have too many decimal places. We may want to round them to fewer decimal places. We can use the round() function for this purpose. A basic syntax of the round() function is as follows.\n\n  round(object, number-of-desired-decimal-places) \n\nIt rounds the object specified in its first argument to the number of decimal places specified in its second argument.\nIn the code below, I assign the output of the addmargins() function to a new object, called ptab_total, and use ptab_total as the first argument of the round() function. The second argument of the round() function is specified at 2.\n\n  ptab_total &lt;- addmargins(ptab, 1) \n  round(ptab_total, 2)\n\n            \n             Worse Same Better\n  Very        0.01 0.04   0.12\n  Fairly      0.16 0.48   0.60\n  Not Very    0.31 0.32   0.22\n  Not At All  0.52 0.16   0.06\n  Sum         1.00 1.00   1.00\n\n\nSince the number specified in the second argument is 2, the values in the crosstab are rounded to two decimal places. By changing the number in the second argument, we can round the values in the corsstab to different decimal places. For example, below we round them to four decimal places.\n\n  round(ptab_total, 4)\n\n            \n              Worse   Same Better\n  Very       0.0130 0.0387 0.1238\n  Fairly     0.1642 0.4827 0.5978\n  Not Very   0.3062 0.3199 0.2203\n  Not At All 0.5165 0.1588 0.0582\n  Sum        1.0000 1.0000 1.0000\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Cross Tabulation in Percentage\nThe crosstab derived above is in terms of proportion. We can change this to one in terms of percentage by simply multiplying the result by 100.\n\n  round(ptab_total, 4) * 100  # We multiply the output of round(ptab_total, 4) by 100.\n\n            \n              Worse   Same Better\n  Very         1.30   3.87  12.38\n  Fairly      16.42  48.27  59.78\n  Not Very    30.62  31.99  22.03\n  Not At All  51.65  15.88   5.82\n  Sum        100.00 100.00 100.00\n\n\nThis crosstab shows the column percentage of each tile for the mosaic plot drawn before in Section 5.1.\n\n\n5.2.6 Sequential Operations on R Objects\nNote that when we derived the crosstab above, we created R objects sequentially by applying different R functions in each step. Below is a summary of these sequantial operations.\n\n  tab &lt;- table( ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt,   \n                ces2019$percep_economy_cps )   \n  ptab &lt;- prop.table(tab, 2)\n  ptab_total &lt;- addmargins(ptab, 1) \n  round(ptab_total, 4) * 100  \n\n            \n              Worse   Same Better\n  Very         1.30   3.87  12.38\n  Fairly      16.42  48.27  59.78\n  Not Very    30.62  31.99  22.03\n  Not At All  51.65  15.88   5.82\n  Sum        100.00 100.00 100.00\n\n\nSpecifically, we first created an object called tab by the table() function. Then, we applied the prop.table() function to tab to create a new object named ptab. After that, the addmargins() function was applied to ptab to create ptab_total. Finally, the round function was applied to ptab_total to produce the crosstab shown above.\nIt is not unusual to use sequantial operations like this to edit R objects to produce the final object that we need.",

    "text": "5.3 Scatterplot\nWhen two variables are both quantitative variables taking many values, we may use a scatterplot to visualize the relationship.\n\n5.3.1 Basic Scatterplot: ggplot() + geom_point()\nBelow we will draw a scatterplot for democrat and ranney3_gub_prop from the usstates2020 data frame. As you can see in the codebook for usstates2020, democrat is the percent of Democratic identifiers — individuals who identify themselves as Democrats — in each state, and ranney3_gub_prop is the proportion of two-party vote for a democratic gubernatorial candidate. We would expect a positive relationship between these two variables. Let’s see whether there is indeed a positive relationship by drawing a scatterplot.\nWe can draw a scatterplot by adding the geom_point() function to the ggplot() function. Note that the aes() function is the argument of the ggplot() function this time. Within the aes() function, we need to specify the independent variable (x = ) and the dependent variable (y = ).\n\n      # aes() is specified in the ggplot() function. It should indicate the independent \nggplot(usstates2010,           # variable (x = ) and the dependent variable (y = ).\n       aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot above suggests that there seems to be a positive relationship, but there are some outliers in the upper left quadrant — some states recorded a very high two party vote share for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate even with a relatively low proportion of Democratic identifiers. The warning message above indicates that there are two observations removed from the visualization because they have missing values for either ranney3_gub_prop or democrat.\nWe can change the shape, size, and color of the points by specifying the shape, col, and size arguments in the geom_point() function as follows.\n\nggplot( usstates2010, \n        aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop) ) +\n  geom_point( shape = 21, col = \"blue\", size = 3 ) # shape, col, and size arguments added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR uses numbers and a few symbols to specify the shape of points. You can look up the shape of points used in R online, for example here (see Figure 5.6, and ignore the rest). As we have already seen, you can find the colors used in R online as well, for example, here and here. You may specify a different number for size to see how the points will change.\nWe may want to display both variables in percentage by multiplying ranney3_gub_prop by 100.\n\nggplot( usstates2010,       # ranney3_gub_prop is multiplied by 100.\n        aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop * 100) ) + \n  geom_point( shape = 21, col = \"blue\", size = 3 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further edit this scatterplot using the functions you have learned. See an example below.\n\nggplot( usstates2010,       \n        aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop * 100) ) + \n  geom_point( shape = 21, col = \"blue\", size = 3 ) +\n  xlab(\"Democratic Identifiers (%)\") +\n  ylab(\"Two-Party Vote Share (%) \\nDemocratic Gubernatorial Candidate\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100), xlim=c(15,75)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Scatterplot by Name of Observations: ggplot() + geom_text()\nSo far we have seen scatterplots by points. We can also use texts instead of points to draw scatterplots. For this purpose, we replace the geom_point() function with the geom_text() function and specify the texts used in a scatterplot in the label argument in the aes() function inside the ggplot() function.\nSee the example below.\n\nggplot(usstates2010, \n       aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop, \n           label = \"test\") ) +  # Specify texts in the label argument in the aes() function.\n  geom_text()                   # Then, use the geom_text() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we specify a single text for the label argument as in the above example, that text is used for all data points. In the above example, I specified label = \"test\", then as you can see, test was used for all data points.\nOr we can specify a variable in the data frame for the label argument. Then, the values of this variable are used for each observation. For the present example, it is useful if we have the name of states for each data point. In the usstates2010 data frame, state is a variable on the name of states, and st is state postal codes. Look up these variables in the usstates2010 data frame by the View() function (alternatively, you can click the name of the data frame in the Environment tab in the upper right pane).\n\n  View(usstates2010)\n\n\nBelow I used st in the label argument.\n\nggplot(usstates2010, \n       aes(x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop, \n           label = st) ) +     # Specify a variable in the label argument in the aes() function.\n  geom_text()                  # Then, use the geom_text() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the size and color of texts by specifying the size and col arguments in the geom_text() function as follows.\n\nggplot( usstates2010, \n        aes( x = democrat, y = ranney3_gub_prop, \n             label = st ) ) +\n              # Try other numbers for the size argument to see \n  geom_text( size=2.5, col=\"blue\" )  # how the size of texts changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that the outliers in the upper left quadrant are Colorado (CO), West Virginia (WV), Montana (MT), and Arkansas (AR).\nWe can of course further edit this scatterplot using the functions we have learned.",

    "section": "5.4 Line Chart & Conditional Means",
    "text": "5.4 Line Chart & Conditional Means\nNow we consider the case in which the dependent variable (y) is a quantitative variable and the independent variable (x) is a categorical variable or a quantitative variable taking a relatively small number of values. In this combination of the types of variables, we may examine the conditional distributions of y across different values of x. In this example, we examine the relationship between percep_economy_cps and trudeau_therm_cps in the ces2019 data frame. This is another simple test of the theory of economic voting.\nFirst, let’s try a scatterplot.\n\nggplot( ces2019, \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_point( size = 0.05 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the missing observations from the plot using the drop_na() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps),   # Use drop_na() to remove missing observations.\n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_point( size = 0.05 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this combination of variables, this scatterplot doesn’t seem to be very informative.\n\n5.4.1 Jittered Scatterplot: ggplot() + geom_jitter()\nOne problem in the above plot is that there seem to be many observations taking the same or very close values, so that multiple observations fall upon exactly the same or very close place. We cannot gauge how many observations are taking which values in this plot.\nOne possible remedy is to jitter the plots. By jittering, we add some random noise to the values of each point, so that the observations taking the same value are spread around this value. To draw a jittered scatterplot, we replace the geom_point() function with the geom_jitter() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_jitter( size = 0.05 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, now the points taking the same values are spread around those values. There seems to be too much jittering in this plot, however. We can control the width and height arguments of the geom_jitter() function to control the amount of random noise added to each point. The width argument controls the amount of noise in the horizontal direction, and the height argument in the vertical direction.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n    # width = the amount of noise added in the horizontal direction.\n    # height = the amount of noise in the vertical direction.\n  geom_jitter( size = 0.05, width = 0.2, height = 0.5 ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above jittered plot, the observations are nicely spread out, so that we can gauge the number of observations falling on the same or similar values more intuitively. Now we can compare the conditional distributions of y across different values of x. From this comparison, there seems to be a positive relationship between these two variables. However, the relationship between these two variables may not be very clear from this visualization. Perhaps, it’s better to SUMMARIZE the conditional distributions of y across different values of x.\n\n\n5.4.2 Conditional Means: ggplot() + geom_point()\nFirst, let’s draw the conditional means of y = trudeau_therm_cps given x = percep_economy_cps. We can do this by modifying the geom_point() function. See an example below.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps, \n             group = 1) ) +  # group = 1 is needed to draw summary statistics.\n         # stat = \"summary\" tells geom_point() to draw summary statistics.\n         # fun = mean specifies that the mean is used as the summary statistics.\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stat = \"summary\" argument tells the geom_point() function to draw summary statistics instead of each observation point. The fun = mean argument tells the geom_point() function to use the (conditional) mean for the summary statistics. We also need to specify group = 1 in the aes() function inside the ggplot() function to draw the conditional means in a plot.\nThen, as you can see above, the ggplot() + geom_point() functions draw the plot of conditional means of y across different values of x.\n\n\n5.4.3 Line chart: ggplot() + geom_line()\nWe may also draw a line chart for the conditional means of y across different values of x. For this purpose, we replace the geom_point() function with the geom_line() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps, \n             group = 1)) +  # group = 1 is needed to draw summary statistics.\n  # Use the geom_line() function instead of the geom_point() function.\n         # stat = \"summary\" tells geom_point() to draw summary statistics.\n         # fun = mean specifies that the mean is used as the summary statistics.\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also combine the plot and the line chart of the conditional means by simply connecting both geom_point() and geom_line() functions derived above.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps, \n             group = 1 ) ) +\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean ) + # Connect the geom_point() and geom_line()\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean )   # functions using a plus sign \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add the shape, size, and color arguments to control the appearance of the points and line.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps, \n             group = 1 ) ) +\n                                      # Use the shape, size, and color arguments.\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, shape = 17, size = 3.5, color = \"purple\" ) +\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, color = \"purple\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow I further edit the line chart with the functions we have learned so far.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps, \n             group = 1 ) ) +\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, shape = 17, size = 3.5, color = \"purple\" ) +\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, color = \"purple\" ) +\n  xlab( \"Perception of Economy\" ) +\n  ylab( \"Feeling Thermometer for Trudeau\" ) +\n  coord_cartesian( ylim = c(0, 100) ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above line chart of the conditional mean of y across values of x is an appropriate visualization to summarize the conditional distributions of y across x.",

We can draw such box plots by the ggplot() + geom_boxplot() functions with the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) specified in the aes() function inside the ggplot() function, as in the example below.\n\nggplot( ces2019,   \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps,       # Specify the independent variable ( x = ) and \n             y = trudeau_therm_cps  ) ) +  # the dependent variable ( y = ) in the aes()\n  geom_boxplot()                           # function inside the ggplot() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s remove the missing observations by the drop_na() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na( ces2019, percep_economy_cps ),  # Use drop_na() to remove missing observations.\n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_boxplot() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also control the width of the boxes by the width argument in the geom_boxplot() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na( ces2019, percep_economy_cps ), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_boxplot( width=0.45 )  # Use the width argument to control the width of boxes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also reflect the relative frequency of each category of x in the width of each box by specifying the varwidth argument to equal TRUE in the geom_boxplot() function.

Recall the bar chart we drew for this variable in Chapter 4, which I have redrawn below for your reference. As you can see, the mode is same, and better has the smallest number of observations. Reflecting this, the width of same is the widest in the box plots above, and that of better is the narrowest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying the varwidth = TRUE may be convenient as we can also see the relative frequency of each category of x at a glance in our box plots.\nWe can further edit the box plots by the functions we have learned.\n\nggplot( drop_na( ces2019, percep_economy_cps ), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n  geom_boxplot( varwidth = TRUE, width = 0.45, fill = \"cyan4\", coef = 0.75 ) +\n  xlab(\"Perception of Economy\") +\n  ylab(\"Feeling Thermometer for Trudeau\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox plots nicely summarize the conditional distributions of y across x with the conditional medians, IQR, and outliers visualized succinctly.\n\n\n5.5.2 Horizontal Box Plots\nThe box plots we saw above are vertical box plots. It is also possible to change them to horizontal box plots. For example, if we want to flip the vertical box plots for the Trudeau thermometer and the perception of economy drawn above to horizontal box plots, we simply add “+ coord_flip()” to the ggplot() function.\n\nggplot( drop_na( ces2019, percep_economy_cps ), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = trudeau_therm_cps ) ) +\n    geom_boxplot( varwidth = TRUE, width = 0.45, fill = \"cyan4\", coef = 0.75 ) +\n  xlab(\"Perception of Economy\") +\n  ylab(\"Feeling Thermometer for Trudeau\") +\n  coord_flip()        # Add the coord_flip() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may not want to use the above horizontal box plots for the current purpose because the Trudeau thermometer is used as a dependent variable and we may prefer having the dependent variable on the vertical axis. On the other hand, if our dependent variable is a categorical variable or interval quantitative variable taking a small number of categories or values and our independent variable is an interval quantitative variable taking many values, then horizontal box plots may be useful to visualize their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose our dependent variable is the perception of economy and the independent variable is respondent’s age (age in the ces2019 data frame). Then, we can visualize their relationship using the horizontal box plots as below.\n\nggplot( drop_na( ces2019, percep_economy_cps ), \n        # You need to specify x = dependent_variable, y = independent_variable\n        # for the current purpose.\n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = age) ) +  \n    geom_boxplot( varwidth = TRUE, width = 0.45, fill = \"dodgerblue\", coef = 0.75 ) +\n  xlab(\"Perception of Economy\") +\n  ylab(\"Age\") +\n  coord_flip() +      # Add the coord_flip() function.\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 100, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important trick here is that you need to specify your dependent variable for x = and your independent variable for y = in the aes() function because these variables are specified for vertical box plots first, and then they are flipped to horizontal box plots.",

    "text": "5.6 Conditional Means & Medians\nIn the previous sections, we visualized the conditional means using a line chart and the conditional medians using boxplots. However, we have not computed the numerical values of these summary statistics. Let’s learn how to compute actual values of the conditional means and medians.\n\n5.6.1 Conditional Means\nTo compute the conditional means and medians, it is convenient to use the pipe operator (|&gt;) together with the group_by() function and the summarize() function in tidyverse.2\nFor brevity, let me first present the code to compute the conditional means without explanation. I will explain it line by line later.\n\nces2019 |&gt; \n    group_by(percep_economy_cps) |&gt;  \n    summarize( cond_mean = mean(trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE) )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  percep_economy_cps cond_mean\n  &lt;fct&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Worse                   25.1\n2 Same                    49.1\n3 Better                  61.9\n4 &lt;NA&gt;                    45.0\n\n\nThe above code produced a table of conditional means of trudeau_therm_cps for each category of percep_economy_cps. The conditional means are named cond_mean.\nThe pipe operator (|&gt;) sends an R object on its left-hand side into a function on its right-hand side as an argument. We say it pipes an R object to a function.\nBelow is a line-by-line explanation of how the above code works.\n\nces2019 |&gt;\n  # The ces2019 data frame is piped to the group_by() function by the pipe operator (|&gt;).\n    \n    group_by(percep_economy_cps) |&gt;\n      # Observations in the ces2019 data frame are grouped by the categories of percep_economy_cps\n      # by the group_by() function, and its output (the grouped data frame) is piped to the  \n      # summarize() function by the pipe operator (|&gt;).\n    \n    summarize(cond_mean = mean(trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE))\n      # The summarize() function applies the mean() function to trudeau_therm_cps for each \n      # group in the ces2019 data frame created by the group_by() function. This generates \n      # the conditional means for each category of percep_economy_cps and assigns them to \n      # a new object named cond_mean.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Conditional Medians\nSimilarly, we can compute the conditional medians. We just need to replace the mean() function in the above code with the median() function.\n\nces2019 |&gt;\n    group_by(percep_economy_cps) |&gt;\n    summarize(cond_median = median(trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE) )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  percep_economy_cps cond_median\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Worse                       15\n2 Same                        50\n3 Better                      70\n4 &lt;NA&gt;                        50",

    "text": "6.1.1 Simple Linear Regression\nIn this chapter, we will estimate a simple linear regression model with only one independent variable. In other words, we examine a bivariate relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable using linear regression.\nIn R, we use the lm() function to estimate a linear regression model. At minimum, the lm() function takes two arguments. A basic syntax of the lm() function in this case is as follows (Don’t execute the following code, which is intended to show you the syntax only).\n\n  lm(formula = dependent_variable ~ independent_variable, data = data_frame_used)\n\nThe first argument of the lm() function is the formula argument. We specify our linear regression model in this argument. Suppose the model we try to estimate is given by the following formula. \\[\n  Y = \\alpha + \\beta X + u\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nThen, we specify the formula argument in the lm function as formula = Y ~ X. That is, ignoring the coefficients, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), we write the dependent variable Y on the left-hand side of tilde, ~, and the independent variable X on the right-hand side.\nThe second argument of the lm() function is the data argument in which we specify the name of the data frame we are using.\nLet’s estimate a linear regression using the usstates2010 data frame, in which the dependent variable is ranney3_gub_prop and the independent variable is democrat. As we saw in Section 5.3, democrat is the percent of Democratic identifiers — individuals who identify themselves as Democrats — in each state, and ranney3_gub_prop is the proportion of two-party vote for a democratic gubernatorial candidate. We would expect a positive relationship between these two variables.\n\n  lm(formula = ranney3_gub_prop ~ democrat, data = usstates2010)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = ranney3_gub_prop ~ democrat, data = usstates2010)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)     democrat  \n   0.267577     0.006604  \n\n\nAt the bottom of the output, we can see the list of coefficients estimated. The number below (Intercept) is the intercept of the linear regression model. This is an estimate of \\(\\alpha\\) in the linear regression model in Equation 6.1. The number below democrat is the coefficient of the democrat variable. This is an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) in the linear regression model in Equation 6.1.\nRecall that ranney3_gub_prop is measured in proportion, a number between 0 and 1, and democrat is measured in percentage, a number between 0 and 100. We can check this by the summary() function.\n\n  summary(usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.2402  0.4071  0.4708  0.4776  0.5355  0.8209       2 \n\n  summary(usstates2010$democrat)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  17.73   27.39   32.52   31.79   34.37   63.20 \n\n\nIt is better to measure them in the same unit. Let’s create a new variable for the two-party vote share of a democratic gubernatorial candidate measured in percentage. Below I create a new variable called gov_vts by using the mutate() function and multiplying ranney3_gub_prop by 100.\n\n  usstates2010 &lt;- mutate(usstates2010, gov_vts = ranney3_gub_prop * 100)\n\nThen, re-estimate the above linear regression model using this new variable.\n\n  lm(formula = gov_vts ~ democrat, data = usstates2010)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gov_vts ~ democrat, data = usstates2010)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)     democrat  \n    26.7577       0.6604  \n\n\nThe coefficient on democrat is 0.66. According to this model, a one percentage-point increase in the Democratic identifiers would lead to, on average, a 0.66 percentage-point increase in the two party vote share of a Democratic gubernatorial candidate.\n\n\n6.1.2 Scatterplot with Linear Regression Line\nIn Section 5.3, we drew a scatterplot of the percentage of Democratic identifiers and the Democratic gubernatorial candidate’s vote share. Let’s add a linear regression line to this scatterplot.\nFirst, let’s redraw the scatterplot.\n\nggplot( usstates2010, \n        aes( x = democrat, y = gov_vts, label = st ) ) +\n  geom_text( size = 2.5, col = \"blue\" ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a linear regression line, we add the geom_smooth() function with the arguments specified below to our scatterplot.\n\nggplot( usstates2010, \n        aes( x = democrat, y = gov_vts, label = st ) ) +\n  geom_text( size = 2.5, col = \"blue\" )  +  # Add geom_smooth() with two arguments,\n  geom_smooth( method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)   #   method = \"lm\" and se = FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom_smooth() function draws a “smoothed” line for the conditional means of y over the values of x in various methods. As we want to draw a linear regression line, we should specify the method argument to lm, which is the function name for a linear regression model in R. If we don’t set the se argument to FALSE, the geom_smooth() function also draws a confidence interval, which is one of the methods of statistical inference. You will learn about confidence intervals later in the semester. As you haven’t learned it yet, let’s set it aside for now.\nYou can also edit the appearance of a linear regression line by specifying the arguments in the geom_smooth() function. Below I used the col (or color or colour) argument to specify color of the line, linetype to set type of the line, and size to change line width. You can find different line types used in R online, for example here. Recall that you can also look up names of colors used in R online, for example, here and here.\n\nggplot( usstates2010, \n        aes( x = democrat, y = gov_vts, label = st ) ) +\n  geom_text( size = 2.5, col = \"blue\" )  +  \n  geom_smooth( method = \"lm\", se = FALSE,    # Add the col, linetype, and size arguments.\n               col =  \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 0.5)",

    "text": "6.2 Ordinal Categorical Variable in Simple Linear Regression\n\n6.2.1 Use Ordinal Categorical Variable As Independent Variable\nNext we use the ces2019 data frame and estimate a linear regression of trudeau_therm_cps on percep_economy_cps. Note that we say that we estimate (or fit) a linear regression of Y on X or we regress Y on X when Y is a dependent variable and X is an independent variable in our linear regression model.\nRecall that percep_economy_cps is an ordinal categorical variable. We cannot use this variable as it is in a linear regression model, because both dependent and independent variables in a linear regression model must be numbers. To estimate a linear regression of trudeau_therm_cps on percep_economy_cps, we first need to assign numbers to each category of percep_economy_cps. Since percep_economy_cps is an ordinal variable, it makes sense to assign numbers corresponding to the order of the categories. As an ordinal categorical variable is stored as a factor in R, we need to transform this variable to a numeric variable.\nAs we saw before in Section 4.3.3, we can transform a factor to a numeric by the as.numeric() function, which preserves the order of levels() (= categories) assigned to a factor variable.\nLet’s create percep_economy_cps_n as we did before.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n      percep_economy_cps = fct_relevel(percep_economy_cps, \n          \"(2) Worse\", \"(3) About the same\", \"(1) Better\") )\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n      percep_economy_cps = fct_recode(percep_economy_cps, \n                                \"Worse\" = \"(2) Worse\", \n                                \"Same\" = \"(3) About the same\", \n                                \"Better\" = \"(1) Better\") )\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n                  percep_economy_cps_n = as.numeric(percep_economy_cps))\n\nLet’s use the head() function to list the values of the first few observations for percep_economy_cps and percep_economy_cps_n to check how the variable was transformed.\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps)\n\n[1] Worse  Same   Better Same   Better Worse \nLevels: Worse Same Better\n\n  head(ces2019$percep_economy_cps_n)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 2 3 1\n\n\nAs you can see in these first few observations, percep_economy_cps_n = 1 if percep_economy_cps is “Worse,” percep_economy_cps_n = 2 if percep_economy_cps is “Same,” and percep_economy_cps_n = 3 if percep_economy_cps is “Better.”\nAs it is transformed into a numeric variable with a proper order, we can use percep_economy_cps_n as the independent variable in our linear regression model.\n\n  lm(formula = trudeau_therm_cps ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trudeau_therm_cps ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  percep_economy_cps_n  \n               8.128                18.982  \n\n\nAs you might have noticed, the values of percep_economy_cps_n are different from the numbers assigned to percep_economy_cps in my lecture. In the lecture, -1, 0, and 1 are used, but 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to percep_economy_cps_n above. As long as consecutive numbers are assigned, the coefficient of percep_economy_cps_n remains the same, although the intercept will be different.\nYou might have also noticed that the coefficient of percep_economy_cps_n produced above is slightly different from the coefficient of the perception of economy variable shown in my lecture. This is because there is a slight difference in the observations included in the analysis above and that presented in my lecture.\nBy the way, the lm() function can still accommodate an ordinal categorical variable, stored as factor, on the right hand side of a linear regression model even without transforming it into a numeric variable. The result, however, will be different from what’s reported above. We will see this in later chapters.\n\n\n6.2.2 Use Ordinal Categorical Variable As Dependent Variable\nNow let’s consider a linear regression model of satisfied_fedgovt on percep_economy_cps_n. Recall that satisfied_fedgovt is also an ordinal categorical variable. So in this application, we use an ordinal categorical variable as the dependent variable for a linear regression model. Again, we need to assign consecutive numbers to the categories of an ordinal categorical variable.\nFirst, construct a numeric version of satisfied_fedgovt. Below I call this new variable satisfied_fedgovt_n.\n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,\n  satisfied_fedgovt = fct_recode(satisfied_fedgovt,\n    \"Not At All\" = \"(4) Not satisfied at all\",\n    \"Not Very\" = \"(3) Not very satisfied\",\n    \"Fairly\" = \"(2) Fairly satisfied\",\n    \"Very\" = \"(1) Very satisfied\") )\n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n  satisfied_fedgovt = fct_relevel(satisfied_fedgovt, \n    \"Not At All\", \"Not Very\", \"Fairly\", \"Very\")) \n\nces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n                  satisfied_fedgovt_n = as.numeric(satisfied_fedgovt))\n\nLet’s use the head() function to check how the variable was transformed. If you specify a number in the second argument of the head() function, then R will display this number of observations for the variable you specified. Below I set this argument to 20, so that the first 20 observations of satisfied_fedgovt are displayed.\n\n                                      # The second argument of the head() function specifies \n  head(ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt, 20) # the number of observations to be displayed.\n\n [1] Fairly     Fairly     Fairly     Fairly     Not At All Not At All\n [7] Not At All Fairly     Not Very   Fairly     Not Very   Not Very  \n[13] Fairly     Fairly     Very       Fairly     Fairly     Fairly    \n[19] Fairly     Fairly    \nLevels: Not At All Not Very Fairly Very\n\n  head(ces2019$satisfied_fedgovt_n, 20) \n\n [1] 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 2 3 2 2 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3\n\n\nAs you can see above, 1 = Not At All, 2 = Not Very, 3 = Fairly, and 4 = Very. Now estimate a linear regression model of satisfied_fedgovt_n on percep_economy_cps_n. As we saw in lectures, linear regression is a model of the conditional means of y across the values of x. Since the current dependent variable is a score from 1 to 4, the conditional mean of this variable is the average score given a specific value of x.\n\n  lm(formula = satisfied_fedgovt_n ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = satisfied_fedgovt_n ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  percep_economy_cps_n  \n              1.1593                0.5753  \n\n\nThe coefficient on percep_economy_cps_n is 0.58, which suggests that the score of satisfaction with the federal government increases, on average, by 0.58 points from Worse to Same or from Same to Better in the respondent’s perception of economy. We can also say that the satisfaction of federal government (satisfied_fedgovt) improves, on average, by approximately one category as the respondent’s perception of economy improves from Worse to Better, because \\(0.58 \\times 2 = 1.16\\).\nBy the way, R can still estimate a linear regression model even without transforming an ordinal categorical variable from factor to numeric. Below I estimate the same model using satisfied_fedgovt, a factor version of this variable, as the dependent variable. In this case, R issues a warning message, as you see below, but it quietly transforms satisfied_fedgovt into a numeric version and estimates regression coefficients.\n\n      # Use satisfied_fedgovt instead of satisfied_fedgovt_n. The lm() function still \n      # estimates a linear regression model but issues a warning message.\n  lm(formula = satisfied_fedgovt ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\nWarning in model.response(mf, \"numeric\"): using type = \"numeric\" with a factor\nresponse will be ignored\n\n\nWarning in Ops.factor(y, z$residuals): '-' not meaningful for factors\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = satisfied_fedgovt ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  percep_economy_cps_n  \n              1.1593                0.5753  \n\n\nAlthough R allows us to use a factor as the dependent variable for the lm() function, as shown above, I’d still suggest you first transform a factor to a numeric variable and use a numeric version of your ordinal categorical variable so that you are fully aware of what you are doing — i.e., you are fully aware of using an ordinal categorical variable as your dependent variable.\nAs I mentioned in my lecture, there are also advanced statistical models when we use an ordinal categorical variable as our dependent variable.1 As such models are beyond the scope of this class, we will use a linear regression model for an ordinal categorical dependent variable in this class.\n\n\n6.2.3 Visualization\nIn Section 5.1, we used a mosaic plot to visualize the relationship between satisfied_fedgovt and percep_economy_cps. With satisfied_fedgovt_n — the numeric version of satisfied_fedgovt — it is also possible to draw a line chart and linear regression line for these variables. Below I used only the functions which you have already learned (so the code does not come with explanations.)\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps), \n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = satisfied_fedgovt_n, \n             group = 1 ) ) +\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, shape = 17, size = 3.5, color = \"blue\" ) +\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth( method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, col=\"red\", linetype = 2) +\n  xlab( \"Perception of Economy\" ) +\n  ylab( \"Satisfaction with Government Score\" ) +\n  coord_cartesian( ylim = c(0.75, 4.25) ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 4, 1))",

    "section": "6.3 Dummy Variable in Simple Linear Regression",
    "text": "6.3 Dummy Variable in Simple Linear Regression\n\n6.3.1 Dummy Variable As Logical Variable in R\nRecall that when we have a dichotomous variable — a variable having a dichotomous outcome — we normally assign 1 to one category and 0 to the other category. Then, this variable is called a dummy variable.2\nConsider union in the ces2019 data frame. As you can see in the codebook for this dataset (ces2019_codebook.pdf), this variable records an answer to the question “Do you belong to a union?” Use the table() function to see its values (categories) and its relative frequency. Below I set the useNA argument to \"always\". Then, the table() function also displays the number of observations with a missing value (NA) for this variable.\n\n                                        # Set the useNA function to \"always\" to display \n  table(ces2019$union, useNA=\"always\")  # the number of observations with missing values.\n\n\n(1) Yes  (2) No    &lt;NA&gt; \n    613    2247    1161 \n\n\nAs you can see, union is a dichotomous variable, as its outcome is either Yes or No. There are many missing values (NA) for this variable, because this is a response to the question asked in the post-election survey (PES) of the Canadian Election Study (CES) in 2019. There are two components in the CES 2019 survey: the first is the campaign period survey (CPS) and the second is the PES. As their names suggest, CPS was conducted during the election campaign in 2019, and PES was conducted after the election. PES includes only a subset of respondents of CPS; i.e., the number of observations is smaller in PES than in CPS.\n\n\n\nFor a dummy variable, there is a more useful type — more precisely called class in R — of variable than factor. This variable class is called logical. A logical variable takes two categories TRUE or FALSE, each of which corresponds to number 1 and 0, respectively. If we use a logical variable in the lm() function, R will treat TRUE of the logical as 1 and FALSE of the logical as 0.\nTo transform the union variable to a logical, first we change the name of categories of union to TRUE and FALSE, and then apply the as.logical() function to change the variable from factor to logical. In the code below, I created a new variable — a logical version of union — called union_d (_d stands for a “d”ummy variable) in this way.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,  # Change the name of categories of union to TRUE and FALSE.\n      union_d = fct_recode(union, \"TRUE\" = \"(1) Yes\", \n                                  \"FALSE\" = \"(2) No\") )\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019,  # Then, apply the as.logical() function.\n      union_d = as.logical(union_d) )\n\nTo check if union_d is constructed as intended, apply the table() function to both uion and union_d to draw a cross table.\n\n      # Draw a cross table of union and union_d using the table() function.\n  table(ces2019$union, ces2019$union_d, useNA=\"always\") \n\n         \n          FALSE TRUE &lt;NA&gt;\n  (1) Yes     0  613    0\n  (2) No   2247    0    0\n  &lt;NA&gt;        0    0 1161\n\n\nAs you can see in the above output, all observations with Yes in union are TRUE in union_d, and those with No in union are FALSE in union_d. Therefore, union_d = TRUE if a respondent is a union member and FALSE otherwise.\nAlso check the class of union and union_d using the class() function. As you can see below, union is a factor but now union_d is a logical.\n\n  class(ces2019$union)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n  class(ces2019$union_d)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Use Dummy Variable As Independent Variable\nNow we can use union_d — the logical version of union — as a dummy variable in the lm() function. Below, we use union_d as the independent variable for a linear regression of trudeau_therm_cps. We may expect that union members are likely to be more liberal than non-members, as Liberals have historically represented the interests of labour. Accordingly, we may expect that trudueau_therm_cps is, on average, higher among union members than otherwise, such that the coefficient on union_d is positive.\n\n  lm(formula = trudeau_therm_cps ~ union_d, data = ces2019)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trudeau_therm_cps ~ union_d, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  union_dTRUE  \n     43.347        2.178  \n\n\nIn the output of the lm() function above, the coefficient of union_d is displayed as union_dTRUE, indicating that this variable is logical. The coefficient is 2.18 — a positive value as we hypothesized. Since uinon_d takes either 0 = FALSE, which represents a non-union member, or 1 = TRUE, which is a union member, a one unit increase in this variable is a switch from a non-union member to a union member. Therefore, the coefficient of union_d represents the difference in the conditional means of the trudeau_therm_cps between the union members and non-members. That is, on average, the Trudeau thermometer is 2.18 points higher among union members than non-union members. While it is positive as we expected, the magnitude of the difference may be too small, as the range of the thermometer is from 0 to 100. In other words, there may be little or no difference in the Trudeau thermometer between union members and non-members. Later in the course, we will learn the methods for statistical inference to aid us to consider whether this difference is real or due to chance alone.\n\n\n6.3.3 Use Dummy Variable As Dependent Variable\nNow we consider the use of a dummy variable as the dependent variable in a linear regression model. Let’s fit a linear regression with union_d as the dependent variable and ideology as the independent variable. Since Liberals have historically represented the interests of labour unions, more liberal respondents may be more likely to be union members.\n\n  lm(formula = union_d ~ ideology, data = ces2019)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = union_d ~ ideology, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)     ideology  \n    0.29418     -0.01628  \n\n\nAs we saw in the lecture, when we use a dummy variable for the dependent variable of a linear regression, this will be a model for the probability of a dummy variable taking 1. In the current context, this is a model for the probability of respondents being union members. A model like this is called a Linear Probability Model or LPM.\nIn the above lm output, the coefficient on ideology is \\(-0.0163\\), which may be interpreted as the change in probability with respect to one unit increase in the independent variable. Since the dependent variable takes either 0 or 1, the coefficient is the change in probability measured in the range of 0 and 1. Hence, this coefficient may be interpreted that one unit increase in the ideological score would lead to the decrease in the probability of the respondents being union members by 0.0163 or 1.63 percentage points. Since the ideological score ranges from 0 to 10, or 11 points, the difference in the probability of being union members between the most liberal and most conservative respondents is \\(0.0163 \\times 10 = 0.163\\) or approximately 16 percentage points.\nBelow I computed the mean of union_d using the mean() function. As you see, the mean of union_d, which is a proportion of union members in the sample, is \\(0.214\\), or approximately 21%.\n\n  mean(ces2019$union_d, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.2143357\n\n\nThis means that if we randomly draw one individual from this sample, the probability of this individual being a union member is \\(0.214\\), or approximately 21%. Compared to this number, the estimated difference in the probability of being union members between the most liberal and most conservative respondents (\\(0.163\\) or approximately 16 percentage points) is a sizable difference in the probability of being union members.\n\n\n6.3.4 Dummy Dependent Variable Constructed from Nominal Categorical Variable\nAn LPM may also be used for a dummy variable created for one category of a nominal categorical variable. In my lecture, I constructed a dummy variable for the vote intention for the Liberal party from a nominal categorical variable of vote intention. Below I create this dummy variable from vote_choice_intended. For this purpose, I use the ifelse() function, which returns a specific value based on a certain condition.\nThe basic syntax for the ifelse() function is as follows (Don’t execute the following code, which is intended to show you the syntax only).\n\n  ifelse(condition, value-if-true, value-if-false)\n\nThe ifelse() function returns value-if-true specified in the second argument, if the condition in the first argument is satisfied, but it returns value-if-false specified in the third argument otherwise.\nWe can use this ifelse() function to create a dummy variable for those who intended to vote for the Liberal party from the nominal categorical variable vote_choice_intended in the following way.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, \n                            # Create a new variable vote_lib using the ifelse() function.\n                    \n                    vote_lib = ifelse(vote_choice_intended == \"Lib\", \"TRUE\", \"FALSE\") )\n                            # This ifelse() function assigns \"TRUE\" to observations if their\n                            # vote_choice_intended is \"Lib\" but assigns \"FALSE\" otherwise.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, # Then, we transform vote_lib into a logical variable.\n                    vote_lib = as.logical(vote_lib) )\n\nIn the ifelse() function in the code above, the condition in the first argument is specified using a double equal sign (==), which is one of the logical operators used in R. Logical operators are used to specify a certain condition to evaluate. The double equal sign (==) evaluates whether the left-hand side of the sign is exactly the same as the right-hand side.\nIn the code above, the condition is vote_choice_intended == \"Lib\". This condition evaluates whether each observation of vote_choice_intended is \"Lib\" or not. Since the second argument of the ifelse() function is \"TRUE\", vote_lib will be \"TRUE\" for the observations for which vote_choice_intended is \"Lib\". On the other hand, the third argument of the ifelse() function is \"FALSE\", so vote_lib will be \"FALSE\" for the observations for which vote_choice_intended is not \"Lib\".\nBy the way, there are many other logical operators which can be used in R. You can find them online, for example, here.\nLet’s check if vote_lib is constructed as intended by drawing a crosstab of vote_lib and vote_choice_intended using the table() function.\n\n  table(ces2019$vote_lib, ces2019$vote_choice_intended, useNA=\"always\")\n\n       \n          BQ  Con Greens  Lib  NDP None of these Other  PPC Will not vote\n  FALSE   98  980    287    0  405            17    24   49             1\n  TRUE     0    0      0  909    0             0     0    0             0\n  &lt;NA&gt;     0    0      0    0    0             0     0    0             0\n       \n        Will spoil ballot &lt;NA&gt;\n  FALSE                 9    0\n  TRUE                  0    0\n  &lt;NA&gt;                  0 1242\n\n\nAs you see in the output above, vote_lib is TRUE for all observations for which vote_choice_intended is Lib but FALSE for all other observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use vote_lib as the dependent variable in the lm() function. The independent variable is percep_economy_cps_n\n\n  lm(formula = vote_lib ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = vote_lib ~ percep_economy_cps_n, data = ces2019)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  percep_economy_cps_n  \n             -0.1196                0.2380  \n\n\nThe coefficient on percep_economy_cps_n is \\(0.24\\), which suggests that the probability of respondents voting for Liberals is higher by 0.24 points or 24 percentage points for those who perceived the state of national economy Better than those who perceived it Same or for those who perceived it Same than those who perceived it Worse. We can also say that the probability of voting for the Liberals is approximately 50 percentage points higher for those who perceived the state of economy Better than those who perceived it Worse, because \\(0.24 \\times 2 = 0.48\\).\nAs in an ordinal categorical variable, there are also advanced statistical models for a dummy dependent variable.3 As such models are beyond the scope of this class, we will use a linear regression model for a dummy dependent variable, or LPM, in this class.\n\n\n6.3.5 Visualization\nAn appropriate visualization for vote_lib and percep_economy_cps may be a mosaic plot.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaicplot(~ percep_economy_cps + vote_lib,\n              data = ces2019,\n              main = \"\",\n              xlab = \"Perception of Economy\",     \n              ylab = \"Vote Intention for Liberals\",\n              las = 1,\n              color = c(\"lightsteelblue2\", \"steelblue4\"))  # Change tile colors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to draw a line chart with a linear regression line for these variables. However, we would need to create a numeric version of vote_lib for this, because the ggplot() functions to draw a line chart do not accept a logical variable as the dependent variable. Below I create a numeric version of vote_lib named vote_lib_n.\n\n  ces2019 &lt;- mutate(ces2019, # Create a numeric version of vote_lib.\n                    vote_lib_n = as.numeric(vote_lib) )\n\n  # Check how the variable is constructed.\n  table(ces2019$vote_lib_n, ces2019$vote_lib, useNA = \"always\")\n\n      \n       FALSE TRUE &lt;NA&gt;\n  0     1870    0    0\n  1        0  909    0\n  &lt;NA&gt;     0    0 1242\n\n\nThen, vote_lib_n is used to draw a line chart with a linear regression line.\n\nggplot( drop_na(ces2019, percep_economy_cps),\n        aes( x = percep_economy_cps, y = vote_lib_n,\n             group = 1 ) ) +\n  geom_point( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, shape = 17, size = 3.5, color = \"blue\" ) +\n  geom_line( stat = \"summary\", fun = mean, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth( method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, col=\"red\", linetype = 2) +\n  xlab( \"Perception of Economy\" ) +\n  ylab( \"Probability of Voting for Liberals\" ) +\n  coord_cartesian( ylim = c(0, 1) ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2))",
