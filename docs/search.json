In POL232, you will learn an elementary use of statistical software called R. In particular, you will use RStudio, a popular and accessible graphical user interface (GUI) to R.\nR is an open source software, and many packages developed by contributors around the world are available for free. To make your learning of R accessible, this book will cover only a limited set of packages and their functionalities specifically used in POL232. Even if you have no experience of programming before, don’t worry, as you will learn what you need in order to complete this class step by step, and we will focus only on a manageable set of functionalities of R. By the end of the semester, you are expected to be able to conduct an elementary quantitative data analysis and write a research paper based on it.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Open RStudio Desktop\nYou may open R and use it directly through its own GUI, but many people find using R through RStudio more intuitive and easier than using R directly. When you use RStudio, you don’t need to open R. Just open RStudio only, as it also quietly starts R behind its GUI. Let’s open RStudio. Then, you will see the following GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we have our work done by executing a command. We enter a command after the &gt; prompt in the R Console, and then, the command will be executed by R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, we can also choose a menu from its GUI, and RStudio translates our input into a command and execute it in the R Console. Let’s see an example by reading the datasets we will use in this class.\n\n\n2.1.2 Datasets Used in POL232\nI prepared the datasets you will use in this class in the RData format, which is available on the class Quercus site. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file to your computer (remember where you downloaded it).\n\n    POL232.RData\n\nLet’s open POL232.RData in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Load Datasets to RStudio: load()\nWe use a menu from GUI of RStudio to load POL232.RData to RStudio. First, choose an open folder icon on the Environment tab on the upper right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, locate POL232.RData on your computer and choose it to open. In the following figure, I have located POL232.RData in the TEMP folder on my Desktop. Note, however, that the location where you have downloaded POL232.RData is different from mine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the content of POL232.RData appears in the upper right pane of RStudio. As you can see, POL232.RData includes five datasets named anes2020, ces2019, ipe2020, ipe2015, and usstates2010. The datasets are stored in the format called data frame in R. So I will call these datasets data frames onward. To learn more about these data frames, see the codebooks available on the class Quercus site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see on the left pane of RStudio (see the red arrow), when we chose POL232.RData to open, RStudio translated this action into an R command and executed in the R Console. The commands used in R consist of R functions. An R function mostly takes the form of function.name(...), and we input arguments in the ... within the parentheses.\nIn the above example, to open POL232.RData, RStudio executed the load() function which takes the name and location (a file path) of the file as its argument (recall that an argument refers to what we specify in the parentheses of R functions). As you can see in the above figure, RStudio used the following code to open POL232.RData.\n\n  load(\"~/Desktop/TEMP/POL232.RData\")\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Browse Data Frame: View()\nLet’s browse a data frame by entering a command in the R console directly. You may use the View() function for this purpose. Include the name of the data frame you want to browse as argument; i.e., include it inside ().\n\n  View(ces2019)\n\nThen, the data frame specified will be open at the upper left pane as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative to typing in View(ces2019) in the R console is to click ces2019 in the Environment tab at the upper right pane.  Then, RStudio will execute View(ces2019) for you to open the data frame in the upper left pane.\nYou may browse the data frame in this way. As you can see, the data frame is structured such that each row corresponds to each observation (in this case, each respondent of the survey) and each column corresponds to each variable. See ces2019_codebook.pdf for the description of the variables included in ces2019.\nI’d suggest you browse other data frames such as anes2020 and ipe2010. Try both typing in the View() function directly in the R console and clicking the name of a data frame on the Environment tab on the upper right pane.\n\n\n2.1.5 Getting Help for Functions: help() or ?\nIf you need help for a function, you may use the help() function with the name of your function of interest in the parentheses or ? operator followed by the name of the function. Try help(View) and ? View. Both of them will open the help window for View() on the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n  help(View)\n  ? View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you have a question about the usage of a specific function, you may use the help() function or the ? operator. If the explanation in the help menu is unclear to you, you may post your question on the Discussions Board of the class Quercus site.",

    "text": "2.2 R Script\nWhen you conduct an analysis in R, you should write a series of functions in an R script file and save it.\nLet’s look at a simple example. Go to the class Quercus site and download the following file.\n\n    POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R is an R script. The file extension .R is used for R scripts. Open this R script file in RStudio by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “Open File…” from the menu bar or clicking the open folder icon () at the upper left corner. (Make sure you do NOT click the open folder icon () at the Environment tab on the upper right pane, because you cannot open an R script from there. Note that if you hover your cursor over the open folder icon at the upper left corner, the following message, “Open an existing file,” should appear as shown below. If you hover your cursor over the icon at the Environment tab on the upper right, the description to appear is “Load Workspace.”)\n\nThen, this R script appears in the top left window of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R contains functions to draw a scatterplot using the usstates2010 data frame. Don’t worry about these functions for now. You will learn how to draw a similar scatterplot later in the semester.\n\n2.2.1 Execute Functions from an R Script\nIf you write a series of functions in an R script like this one, you can easily repeat your analysis. From an R script file, you can execute the functions.\nIn POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, go to a line or highlight a line (or a set of lines), and then press Ctrl + Enter in Windows or Command + Return in Mac. Then, the functions chosen will be implemented in the R Console. Alternatively, you may click the “Run” icon ().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you execute all the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R, RStudio will draw the following scatterplot on the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Write Comments After #\nPOL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R produced a scatterplot with a linear regression line for the relationship between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial candidate and the percent of Democratic identifiers, individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across US states.\nBelow is a copy of this R script. As I suggested above, don’t worry about what these functions in the R script are doing. I am showing the content of the R script below only to explain how you can write comments in your R script file.\n\n# Estimate a simple linear regression model for the relationship\n# between the proportion of two-party vote share for a democratic gubernatorial\n# candidate (ranney3_gub_prop) and the percent of Democratic identifiers\n# (democrat), individuals who identify themselves as Democrats, across\n# US states, and assign its result to the object named \"us.\"\nus &lt;- lm(formula = ranney3_gub_prop*100 ~ democrat, data=usstates2010)\n\n# Draw a scatterplot using presidential election years.\nplot(usstates2010$democrat, usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n     type=\"n\",\n     ylim=c(0,100), xlim=c(15, 75),\n     main=\"US Gubernatorial Elections\",\n     ylab=\"Vote Share (%) of Dem Candidate\",\n     xlab=\"Democratic Identifiers (%)\",\n     cex.main=1.0, cex.lab=1.0, cex.axis=1.0)\ntext(x=usstates2010$democrat, y=usstates2010$ranney3_gub_prop*100,\n    usstates2010$st, col=\"blue\", cex=0.75)\n\n# Add a linear regression line.\nabline(a=us$coefficients[1],b=us$coefficients[2],\n    col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\nIn the above R script, you may notice that some descriptions are given after #. In an R script file, everything after # will not be executed by R. When R implements these functions, it ignores everything after #. Therefore, we can write comments after #.\nI suggest you sufficiently annotate your R script using # so that you can understand what you did when you come back to work on your R project after a while.\n\n\n2.2.3 Always Write an R Script\nI suggest you always create an R script file, write functions and comments in this R script, and save this script when you conduct analysis in R, because this may be the most transparent and effective way to save and reproduce your analysis.\nTherefore, in every R lab session, I will ask you to write an R script file and submit it to Quercus by the end of the lab session to earn a participation mark, so that you can develop the habit of writing R scripts.",

    "section": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script",
    "text": "2.3 Practice Writing an R Script\n\nLet’s write a very simple R script to try some very basic (mathematical) operations in R.\n\n2.3.1 How to Start a New R Script\nYou may start a new file by choosing “File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “New File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “R Script” from the menu bar (left in the image below) or simply clicking the “New File” icon () and choose “R Script” (right in the image below).\n\nOnce you create a new R script, you should of course save it. You can save it by choosing “File” from the pull down menu and then “Save As” (left in the image below) or clicking the save file icon (right in the image below).\n\nYou should choose an informative name for your R script. For the current purpose, name your R script “POL232_Lab1_YourLastName.R.”\n\n\n2.3.2 Very Basic Math\nFirst, write the following mathematical operations in your R script and execute them from within the R script. See Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run functions from within an R script.\n\n  1 + 5     # Addition\n  2 - 3     # Subtraction\n  4 * 7     # Multiplication\n  2735 / 45 # Division\n  2^4       # Exponents\n  sqrt(16)  # Square root\n  abs(-5)   # Absolute value\n  1:100     # Sequence of integers from 1 to 100\n\nThen, these mathematical operations will be carried out in the R Console. Each of them returns the output of the operation — for example, 6 for 1 + 5, and -1 for 2 - 3.\nRecall that R ignores everything after #, so you can annotate your R script after #.\nNext, write 5:100 as follows in your R script and execute it. You will get the output that follows — a sequence of numbers from 5 to 100.\n\n  5:100    # Sequence of integers from 5 to 100\n\n [1]   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23\n[20]  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42\n[39]  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61\n[58]  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80\n[77]  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99\n[96] 100\n\n\nIn the output, numbers in square brackets at the beginning of each line represent a position of the first entry of each line. As you see in the above output, 5 is the first entry of 5:100, and 24 is the 20th entry of 5:100, 43 is the 39th, and so forth.\n\n\n2.3.3 Create a Variable Using the Assignment Operator (&lt;-)\nWe can create a variable and assign a number or multiple numbers to this variable using the assignment operator, &lt;-. First, let’s assign a single number to a variable.\nFor example, the following operation will assign the result of 1 + 5, which is 6, to a variable named y. Write this operation in your R script and then execute it (once again, see Section 2.2.1 if you forget how to run a function from within an R script).\n\n  y &lt;- 1 + 5  # The assignment operator, &lt;-, will assign the values on the right-hand-side \n              # to a variable named y.\n\nTyping in the variable name in the R Console will print its content. Try this.\n\n  y\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nIt returns 6.\nNow write the following operation in your R script and execute it to create a different variable x.\n\n  x &lt;- 7\n\nCheck its content by typing the variable name, x, in the R Console.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIt returns 7. You can overwrite a variable by assigning a different number to the variable. Write the following operation in your R script and execute it.\n\n  x &lt;- 10\n\nNow your x should be changed to 10. Type in x in the R Console to confirm.\n\n  x\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nYou can apply mathematical operations on variables. For example, write the following operations — sqrt() to take a square root — in your R script and execute them.\n\n  y + x        # Because y = 6 & x = 10, this is 16.\n\n[1] 16\n\n  sqrt(y + x)  # This will take a square root of 16, which is 4.\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nYou may assign the result of a mathematical operation on variables to another variable. Write the following operations in your R script and execute them.\n\n  z &lt;- y + x  # z will be the result of y + x. Since y = 6 and x = 10, z = 16.\n\n  z           # Executing this from your R script is equivalent to typing in `z` into the R Console.\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 See What’s in Your Workspace (= Working Memory): ls() or objects()\nWhat you have created so far (called “objects”) in the current R session have been stored in the R’s working memory, called workspace. You can see what is available in your workspace by executing ls() or objects() without arguments (= nothing in the parentheses). objects() may be more intuitive because anything you construct in R is called an object.\nWrit the following functions in your R script and execute them.\n\n  objects()  # This function will list everything in your workspace.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\n\n  ls()       # This function does the same thing as the objects() function.\n\n[1] \"anes2020\"     \"ces2019\"      \"ipe2010\"      \"ipe2015\"      \"us\"          \n[6] \"usstates2010\" \"x\"            \"y\"            \"z\"           \n\n\nYou can also see what’s stored in your workspace at the Environment tab at the upper right pane.\n\nNote that everything you created and stored in your workspace will be gone, once you quit R. This is fine, as you can always recreate the objects you created in the current R session easily by running the functions recorded in your R script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Remove a Variable from Your Workspace: remove() or rm()\nIf you want to remove or erase a variable from your workspace, use remove() or its abbreviation rm(). For example, remove(x) or rm(x) will erase x from your workspace. Write the following function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(x)   # This function will remove the variable `x` from your workspace.\n\nType in x in the R Console to see that this variable is not available anymore. The error message will suggest that the variable x cannot be found.\n\n\n2.3.6 Remove Everything: remove(list=ls()) or rm(list=ls())\nIf you want to remove everything from your workspace, you may use the following function. Write this function in your R script and execute it.\n\n  remove(list=ls())  # This will erase everything from your workspace.\n\nRun objects() or ls() to see that everything is gone. character{0} means there is nothing in your workspace.\n\n  ls()\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nMake sure you save your R script. This R script may be used as your reference in your later work.",

You can skip the following. Since this question is no longer asked in the recent versions of RStudio Desktop, you may not see this question when you quit your R session.\nHowever, I want to give the following explanations in case you encounter this question when you quit your R session, because this is a default behaviour of R, which is run quietly behind RStudio. There may be an occasion in which you will see this question.\nBy clicking “Save,” you can save all your R session in a workspace image (.RData file) and can open it the next time you start R.\nHowever, I do NOT recommend using this option. It is much better to record all your work in an R script and replicate all your work by executing the R script.\nUsing R scripts allows you to correct your mistakes easily, and all the steps of your work will be transparent. You may also allow others to replicate your work by running your R script.\nAlways choose “Don’t Save” when you quit R and write an R script instead.",

    "text": "1.2 Use RStudio from JupyterHub\nAs a UofT student, you have an access to JupyterHub. While you can download and install R and RStudio on your computer, you may also use RStudio online from JupyterHub. In this option, you can avoid all the troubles in installing R and RStudio. Especially if you encounter any issues in installing R and RStudio on your computer, this will be a viable alternative.\nIn this section, I explain how to use RStudio online through JupyterHub.\nTo access RStudio from JupyterHub, go to https://datatools.utoronto.ca/ and choose RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Log On” and login using your utorid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, RStudio Server will open on your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use RStudio online.\n\n1.2.1 Prepare for POL232 on JupyterHub\nFirst, I suggest you create a folder for POL232.\nClick “New Folder” in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in a name of the folder. Here I use “POL232.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the new folder appears in the lower right pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we use the datasets in POL232.RData, we first need to upload this file to RStudio on JupyterHub. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, go to the class Quercus site and download POL232.RData.\nThen, let’s upload POL232.RData to RStudio on JupyterHub.\nClick the “Upload” icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the following pop-up window appears. You first need to choose the target directory, which is a folder to which you upload POL232.RData.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand choose the folder you just created. Here I choose the “POL232” folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, select POL232.RData on your local drive to upload.\nClick “Browse”…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate POL232.RData on your local drive and select it. Note that the location of POL232.RData on your local drive is different from mine shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit “OK” to upload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, POL232.RData appears in the folder you created in the lower right pane (the “POL232” folder in my case shown below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can upload other files, if necessary, to RStudio on JupyterHub in the same way.\nFor example, to complete Section 2.2, you may want to upload POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R.\nClick these files in your folder in the lower right pane to open them.

In the example shown below, I save a scatterplot produced by the functions in POL232_R_Lab1_Example1.R (see Section 2.2.1).\nTo save the scatterplot, first choose “Export” on the Plots tab in the lower right pane and choose “Save as Image”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, choose the folder to which you will save the plot and specify a name of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the “Files” tab in the lower right pane, then you can see that the plot you have saved appears there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese files saved in your folder is saved in your cloud account for JupyterHub. They will stay there after you log out, and you can use them when you come back to JupyterHub.\n\n\n1.2.3 Download Output\nYou can also download the files you saved online in RStudio on JupyterHub to your computer.\nCheck the file you want to download, and click “More.” Then, choose “Export” from the pull-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the pop-up window, you may change a file name, if you want. Click “Download” to save the file on your computer locally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R lab sessions during the class time or tutorial sessions, you will be required to upload the R script or some other files that you create during the sessions to the class Querus site. For this purpose, you first need to download these files to your local computer, and then, you will upload these files to Quercus from the local computer.",

There are thousands of packages available. You can see the currently available packages in this list.\nYou can see which packages were already downloaded in your R library in the Packages tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\nYou may also use the library() function without an argument. If you run this function in RStudio, the R packages available tab will appear in the upper left pane.\n\n  library()\n\n\nIf this is the first time you use R, what you see here is the list of default R packages which came together with the installation of R. If we want to use R packages not included in this default list, we first need to download and install them on our computer.\n\n1.4.1 Install Package: install.packages()\nIn POL232, we are going to use a few packages included in tidyverse, a popular collection of multiple R packages. If you download and install tidyverse, multiple packages included therein will be installed on your computer. In particular, we will often use dplyr and ggplot2 from the tidyverse family of packages in this course.\nTo install a package, you can use the install.packages() function.\n\n  install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nOr you may choose Install Packages… from the Tools menu.\n\nThen, type in the name of a package you want in the pop up window, and hit Install.\n\nAnother way to launch the above pop up window is to hit the Install icon () on the Packages tab at the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Load Package to Current R Session: library()\nTo use an R package you installed on your computer, you need to first load this package to your current R session using the library() function. For example, the following function loads all packages in tidyverse.\n\n  library(tidyverse)\n\nWe can now use the functions included in the family of tidyverse packages, including dplyr and ggplot2. These functions are accessible during your current R session.\nIf you quit R and restart an R session, you need to load tidyverse again by the library() function.\nNote that you don’t need to download and install the package you need every time you want to use it — once you have downloaded and installed it, it stays in your computer. You just need to load it into your current R session by the library() function, every time you start R.",

Recall that you don’t need to launch R because RStudio quietly opens R behind its GUI.\nIf you use RStudio on JupyterHub and don’t remember how to use it, see Section 1.2.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Load POL232.RData\n\nMake sure you load POL232.RData into your current R session. If you forget how to load POL232.RData into your current R session, see Section 2.1.3.\nIf you use RStudio on JupyterHub or your own computer, you are likely to have already downloaded and stored POL232.RData in your local folder either on your JupyterHub account or your own computer.\nHowever, if you use RStudio on a lab computer in SS 561, you first need to download POL232.RData from the class Quercus site because everything you saved on the lab computer is gone once you logged out from it.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Prepare R Script\n\nI suggest you write everything you do in RStudio in an R script and run R functions from within the R script. If you need a refresher for R script, read Section 2.2 and Section 2.3.\nFor the current purpose, start a new R script and name it “POL232_Lab#_YourLastName.R” in which # is the number of the current lab session (e.g., POL232_Lab2_YourLastName.R, POL232_Lab3_YourLastName.R). See Section 2.3.1 for how to start a new R script.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Load Packages\n\nFor the current chapter, you also need to load tidyverse package into your current R session (Section 1.4.2).\n\n\n  library(tidyverse)\n\n\nIf you don’t know about or forget about R packages, read Section 1.4.\nIf library(tidyverse) returns an error message suggesting there is no package called 'tidyverse', this means that tidyverse is not installed on your computer. In this case, you first need to install it. See Section 1.4.1 for how to dowonload and install R packages.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Actually Write R Functions\n\nI suggest you actually write the R functions used below in your R script instead of copying and pasting them. By actually writing them and occasionally making mistakes and correcting them, you can get used to how RStudio works more quickly and effectively.\nIf you simply copy and paste them, you will not learn much about RStudio and will not get used to it.\nIn your R script, leave sufficient descriptions of the functions after the # sign (see Section 2.2.2) so that you can use your R script later as your reference when you conduct analysis using these R functions.\nThese descriptions are notes for yourself. Organize these descriptions/notes so that they are convenient for your futur use.",

    "section": "3.2 Histogram: ggplot() + geom_histogram()",
    "text": "3.2 Histogram: ggplot() + geom_histogram()\nLet’s draw a histogram for the Trudeau thermometer in the Canadian Election Study 2019 (ces2019), which records how a respondent feels about Justin Trudeau, the incumbent prime minister in 2019, on a scale from 0 (coldest feeling) to 100 (warmest feeling).\nWe use the ggplot() function for this purpose.\nRecall that an R function mostly takes the form of function.name(...), and we specify arguments in the ... within the parentheses. A basic syntax of the ggplot() function to draw a histogram is as follows. (Don’t implement the code below, which is intended only to show the syntax of the ggplot function and is not intended to be implemented. You will get an error message if you implement the following code.)\n\n  ggplot(name-of-data-frame, aes(name-of-variable)) + \n      geom_histogram()\n\nFirst, the ggplot function takes two arguments at minimum. (Once again, recall that what a function takes in its parentheses () is called an argument.) The first argument is the name of the data frame that contains the variable we want to visualize, and the second argument is the aes() function. Since the second argument is a function, it also takes arguments. The aes() function takes one argument at minimum, the name of the variable which we want to visualize.\nIn summary, the ggplot function tells R which variable from which data frame we want to visualize.\nThen, the ggplot function should be followed by the geom_histogram() function connected by a plus sign (+). We may also specify arguments for the geom_histogram() function, but it still works without any arguments.\nLet’s try this function. There are two Trudeau thermometers in ces2019: the one asked during the election campaign, truedau_therm_cps, and the other asked after the election, truedau_therm_pes. Here we use the one asked during the campaign, truedeau_therm_cps.\nRun the following function — in particular, write it in your R script and run it from there. See Section 2.2.1 for how to execute R functions from your R script.\nThen, a histogram will appear in the Plots tab at the lower right pane.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) +\n    geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 45 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there is a warning message suggesting that R removed “45 rows containing non-finite values.” What this means is that when it drew this histogram, R removed 45 observations for which trudeau_therm_cps is missing.1\n\nWhile the above simple specification of the ggplot() function can produce the histogram above, it doesn’t look great. We should edit this histogram further such that it looks better. To do this, we may add further functions connected by a plus sign (+) to the ggplot() function and/or specify more arguments to these functions.\nLet’s try what we can do step by step.\n\n3.2.1 Location and Width (or Number) of Bins: boundary, binwidth, bins\nFirst, you may have noticed that the left most bin is centered at 0, and the right most bin is centered at 100, although the value of trudeau_therm_cps ranges from 0 to 100 — i.e., there are no observations with the values smaller than 0 or greater than 100. We may want to adjust the histogram such that the bins are drawn within the possible values of the variable — in this case, between 0 and 100. We can do this by setting the boundary argument in the geom_histogram() function.\nIf you set the boundary argument at the minimum value of the variable — 0 in the current case — then the histogram is adjusted such that the left most bin starts from this minimum value, rather than starting just before this minimum value.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n      geom_histogram(boundary=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the histogram looks slightly better, but you may think that the bin width is too narrow, or equivalently, the number of bins is too many. We can adjust this by specifying either the bin width by the binwidth argument or the number of bins by the bins argument in the geom_histogram() function.\nBelow I use the binwidth argument to specify the width of each bin as 10 points.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n      geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the histogram looks much better.\n\n\n3.2.2 Color of Bins: fill, color\nSuppose you want to change the color of the bins. We can specify the fill argument in the geom_histogram function as below. You may specify the name of the color you want. You can find the color names used in R online, here and here, for example.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the boundaries of each bin are not clear. Let’s draw a line around each bin. We can do this by specifying the color argument in the geom_histogram function. I made these lines black below, but you may of course choose a different color.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Title and Axis Labels: labs(), ylab(), xlab()\nWe can add a title by adding the labs() function, and we can change the axis labels by the ylab() and xlab() functions. Below I added a title that reads “Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU” and changed the Y-axis label from the default “count” to “Number of Observations” and the X-axis label from the default variable name (trudeau_therm_cps) to nothing. Don’t forget to connect all these functions by a plus sign (+).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Values and Tick Marks Appearing on the X and Y Axes: scale_x_continuous(), scale_y_continuous()\nWe can also change the values of the variable on the X-axis at which tick marks and numbers appear by the scale_x_continuous() function with the breaks argument. In the histograms above, the tick marks and numbers appear at 0 to 100 with an interval of 25. Below I change them to 0 to 100 with an interval of 10. For this purpose, the breaks argument is set to seq(0, 100, 10).\nThe seq(starting-number, ending-number, interval) function is another function which produces a sequence of numbers from starting-number to ending-number with the specified interval. That is, seq(0, 100, 10) produces a sequence from 0 to 100 with an interval of 10.\nAs you can see in the X-axis of the histogram below, setting breaks = seq(0, 100, 10) in the scale_x_continuous function (the last line of the code below) changes the values and tick marks at the X-axis to 0 to 100 with an interval of 10.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry other values to see how the values and tick marks change on the X-axis. For example, if you change this to seq(20, 60, 20) (the last line of the code below), then the values and tick marks appear only from 20 to 60 with an interval of 20.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(20, 60, 20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the values and tick marks on the Y-axis, we can add the scale_y_continuous function with the same breaks argument. Below I change the values and tick marks to 0 to 1000 with an interval of 200 (the last line).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, 200))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Range of Values at the X and Y Axes: coord_cartesian()\nWe can also change the range of values appearing on both X and Y axes by adding the coord_cartesian() function with the xlim and ylim arguments, respectively. In the code below at the last line, I added coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1200)) to change the range of values on the Y-axis to the range between 0 and 1200. Accordingly, I also changed the ending value of the breaks argument in the scale_y_continuous function to 1200 (the second to the last line).\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, 200)) +\n    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as an example, I also added the xlim argument to the coord_cartesian() function below (the last line) to shorten the range of X-axis.\n\n  ggplot(ces2019, aes(trudeau_therm_cps)) + \n    geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 10, fill = \"palegreen\", color = \"black\") +\n    labs(title=\"Feelings about JUSTIN TRUDEAU\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of Observations\") +\n    xlab(\"\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1200, 200)) +\n    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1200), xlim = c(20,80))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can draw a pretty nice histogram for the variable of your interest.",

Let’s compute the mean and median of a variable using RStudio. We use the mean() and median() functions, respectively.\n\n3.5.1 Compute Mean and Median: mean(), median()\nLet’s compute the mean of the variable trudeau_therm_cps. The mean() function takes a variable name as their argument.\nAs trudeau_therm_cps is one column of the data frame ces2019, we need to use $ to access it — more specifically, we can refer to trudeau_therm_cps as ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps.\nIf you type in ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps in the R Console (try this), R will print the values of this variable (or the corresponding column of ces2019) in the Console. In general, the syntax to access a variable in a data frame is name-of-data-frame$name-of-variable. We connect the name of the data frame and the name of the variable by a dollar sign ($).\nThe mean() function takes the name of a variable specified this way as their argument. In addition, we should specify another argument, na.rm, as shown below.\n\n  mean(ces2019$trudeau_therm_cps, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 43.71655\n\n\nHere, na.rm means “remove NA.”\nIn R’s data frame, all missing values are recorded as NA.

You can find the names of the line types used in R online, for example, here.\n\n  hist_trudeau2 &lt;- hist_trudeau + \n    geom_vline(xintercept = 43.72, linetype =  \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 50, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"blue\")\n  print(hist_trudeau2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the above code, we created a new object hist_trudeau2, which updates the ggplot() functions in hist_trudeau with the geom_vline() function, and then used the print() function to draw this new histogram.",

    "text": "3.7 Add Texts to Histogram: annotate(\"text\")\nWe can also add texts to a histogram with the annotate() function. This function annotates a histogram with several different elements, one of which is texts. To add texts to our histogram, we specify the first argument of the annotate() function as \"text\". The function also takes the x and y arguments, which specifies the location of the texts, and the label argument, which specifies the content of the texts we want to add. The values of the x and y arguments are from the values of the X-axis (the horizontal axis) and the Y-axis (the vertical axis) of the histogram we have drawn. Recall that in our histogram about the Justin Trudeau thermometer variable, the values of the Y-axis range from 0 to 1200 and those of the X-axis range from 0 to 100. Based on these values, the x and y arguments determine the location of the center of the texts. I also added the color argument to specify the text color.\n\n  hist_trudeau3 &lt;- hist_trudeau2 +   \n    annotate(\"text\", x = 80, y = 1100, label = \"Mean = 43.72\", color = \"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 80, y =  900, label = \"Median = 50\", color = \"blue\")\n  print(hist_trudeau3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, I tried other values for the x and y arguments to demonstrate how the texts move. As you can see, the text for the median is now outside the range of the histogram. I’d suggest you try other values for the x and y arguments to see how the location of the texts changes.\n\n  hist_trudeau3 &lt;- hist_trudeau2 +   \n    annotate(\"text\", x = 20, y = 1200, label = \"Mean = 43.72\", color = \"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 95, y =  700, label = \"Median = 50\", color = \"blue\")\n  print(hist_trudeau3)",
